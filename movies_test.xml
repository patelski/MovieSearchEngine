<reviews>
<review>The climax is the biggest letdown, a giant hash of crosscutting and unremarkable (in an era in which we've seen everything) CGI.</review>
<review>A competently made, sporadically entertaining superhero action movie that will make a lot of money for Marvel and Fox.</review>
<review>Good, clean summer movie fun where the money they spend is up on the screen - with actors and effects</review>
<review>Magneto used to be a globe-trotting Bond-a-like and Xavier was a beer-chugging ladies man? Admit it, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart suddenly seem much more interesting.</review>
<review>As visually impressive as X-Men: First Class can be, Vaughn is a natural storyteller and he never loses sight of what the big picture is.</review>
<review>This new entry to the "X-Men" saga will please fans and non-fans of the comic book heroes alike, shaking things up by giving us a little something new from the franchise.</review>
<review>Matthew Vaughn still proves that he's a terrific and entertaining filmmaker, while still retaining a distinct style.</review>
<review>Comic-book lovers, fans of alternate history, and fantasy-prone moviegoers in general are all sure to find something to love about X-Men: First Class.</review>
<review>One of the five worst films of 2011. Inexplicably acclaimed, incredibly dumb.</review>
<review>A first-rate action film with great special effects and an effective origin tale to tell--perhaps the best of the X-Men series so far.</review>
<review>With so many characters to introduce or reintroduce, Vaughn has a lot of ground to cover, and he does it in a way that at once feels retro and modern.</review>
<review>There's something to be respected about a film that doesn't spend most of its time in mindless action</review>
<review>As X-Men films go, this one gets the job done and is certainly better than Last Stand or Wolverine. But there are still just too darn many X-Men.</review>
<review>While it never reaches the intelligence or character richness of the first two X-Men films, it's still the superior superhero spectacle of 2011 to date.</review>
<review>As a story of the founding of the mutant academy, First Class delivers on the double meaning of its title, twice.</review>
<review>In Matthew Vaughn's pitch-perfect, fluid, sparklingly edited movie, we learn about demons. And wouldn't you know it? It's all about Jewish revenge.</review>
<review>Its attributes and weaknesses can be broken down into two categories: the relationship between Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), and everything else</review>
<review>In a summer unfortunately glutted with superhero movies, every one an origins story, X-Men: First Class not only eclipses its competition, but also each of its franchise predecessors.</review>
<review>First Class might even be too good for its predecessors' comfort. An unintended consequence of its sure handed grip on character is the retroactive tarnishing of the original films.</review>
<review>Not only the best X-Men film to date, but the best superhero flick yet.</review>

<name>Kick-Ass</name>
<score>77</score>
<MovieInfo>Adapted from Mark Millar's hyper-violent comic book of the same name, director Matthew Vaughn's (Layer Cake) vigilante superhero film tells the tale of an average New York teenager who decides to don a costume and fight crime. Comic book geek Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) may not have good coordination or special powers, but that doesn't mean he isn't a fully capable crime fighter. After purchasing a flashy wet suit on the Internet, Dave starts busting up baddies with nothing but brute force. He calls himself Kick-Ass, and he can take a beating as good as he can dish one out. Before long, Kick-Ass has become a local sensation, and others are following his lead. Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) are a father-daughter crime-fighting duo who have set their sights on local mob heavy Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). They're doing a decent job of dismantling Frank's sizable underworld empire when Kick-Ass gets drawn into the fray. But Frank's men play rough, and his son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), is about to become Kick-Ass' very first arch nemesis. When Chris assumes the persona of Red Mist, the stage is set for a superhero showdown that could spell the end of Kick-Ass once and for all. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>A tremendously fresh experience.</review>
<review>It could be argued that you can't have your cape and eat it, but for the most part Kick-Ass is witty, knowing and hugely fun.</review>
<review>With its electrifying action sequences, a killer storyline and a maverick comic sensibility, the brilliance of Kick Ass will hit those who want to see it like a thunderbolt.</review>
<review>If you're not too put-off by lots of violence and profanity, and enjoy a good action-filled popcorn flick, then chances are you're going to love "Kick-Ass."</review>
<review>If you want to get serious, you could say that Kick-Ass is the movie that could finally drag comic-books into the credible mainstream. But being serious is to miss the point of Kick-Ass completely.</review>
<review>Where do I stand on Kick-Ass? On the fence, goggling with a mix of appalled fascination and guilty pleasure at the film's dark comedy and over-the-top violence.</review>
<review>Kick-Ass gains significant momentum in its second half, once it abandons the arch origin-story material and starts staking a claim as a straight-up action flick.</review>
<review>Fast, funny, and a hell of a lot of fun, Vaughn's film does, indeed, live up to the brash punch of its title.</review>
<review>... It feels fresh, with an edge about it that allows you to think anything can happen to any character at any time.</review>
<review>Most of the lessons in Kick-Ass are juvenile, but Lordy are they stylishly told.</review>
<review>Defiantly irreverent and gleefully violent.</review>
<review>The movie just decided that thoughtlessness and splatter was its own reward. I'm okay with that.</review>
<review>Never has a title been so true, so funny, and so simple as that of Kick-Ass.</review>
<review>Kick-Ass is so refreshingly iconoclastic, it's a wonder it was made at all.</review>
<review>Kick-Ass is such an exciting, refreshing development in comic book filmmaking that I want to shout it from the rooftops</review>
<review>Kick Ass is about as exciting as movies get. Not just because it is a (mostly) anarchic splatter-fest that celebrates (nay, encourages) acts of ridiculous violence, but also the fact that it was made completely outside of the studio system.</review>
<review>A bait-and-switch movie that lucks out because its switch is so much more appealing than its bait.</review>
<review>Your appreciation will depend in how much you can appreciate it's utter wrongness as a twisted virtue.</review>
<review>America could probably use a good laugh just about now, what with all the problems plaguing this society. But the exploitation of children even if they are actors and the special effects are occasionally awesome, is way beyond just not cool.</review>
<review>A genre dress-up play date from hell.</review>

<name>Super</name>
<score>49</score>
<MovieInfo>In the outlandish dark comedy SUPER, James Gunn has created what is perhaps the definitive take on self-reflexive superheroes. When sad-sack loser Frank (Rainn Wilson) sees his ex-addict wife (Liv Tyler) willingly snatched by a seductive drug dealer (Kevin Bacon), he finds himself bereft and wholly unable to cope. But soon he decides to fight back under the guise of a DIY superhero called Crimson Bolt. With a hand-made suit, a wrench, and a crazed sidekick named Boltie (Ellen Page), the Crimson Bolt beats his way through the mean streets of crime in hopes of saving his wife. The rules were written a long time ago: You are not supposed to molest children, cut lines or key cars; if you do, prepare to face the wrath of the Crimson Bolt! No stranger to rebel filmmaking, James Gunn cut his teeth writing for Troma before making his directing debut with 2006's SLITHER. In a similar vein, his follow-up feature combines absurd humor with balls-out violence to create something that is both unashamed and inimitable. But this time Gunn adds a new ingredient, one that is dark, dramatic and subversive to the core. -- (c) IFC Films R,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>Gunn's movie is an ingeniously nasty concoction that feeds the cult of superhero fandom back into itself.</review>
<review>Great dark humor and enjoyable performances make this one a winner. Surprisingly, the animated sequences also work quite well.</review>
<review>The graphic violence spatters along for an hour and a half until we reach that point when writer-director James Gunn says, "That's all I've got" and basically gives up.</review>
<review>[Not] an easily digestible movie but this is ... the point - in a world where everything isn't as cut and dry as 'good versus evil', rationality is increasingly rare.</review>
<review>Super can be very affecting and emotionally disturbing, which might not suit everyone's tastes, but it's also an absorbing, bleak and sometimes funny deviation from the usual superhero fodder.</review>
<review>I liked Super more than I did Defendor. . . .</review>
<review>Super is the sudden kick in the crotch this summer of square-jawed superheroes never knew it needed.</review>
<review>I will say this of Super: it commits to its premise far better than Kick-Ass; if you thought the latter was violent, you haven't seen Rainn Wilson cracking someone's head repeatedly on a rock. But at least Kick-Ass was fun.</review>
<review>Super is a film infused with that impossibly compelling mix of deeply empathic insights, disturbingly-visualised violence and goodwill-rousing positive energy.</review>
<review>Both [Super &amp; Kick-Ass] feature ... crazy vigilantes ... but whereas Kick-Ass disguised its unsettling subtext beneath a hip and stylish surface, the scuzzy, low-budget Super forces the viewer to confront its disturbing side head on.</review>
<review>Not simple knockabout fun ... and therein lies both the attraction and the challenge.</review>
<review>Where it completely fails is when the in-your-face amorality is contextualised with an icky epilogue which tries to justify what came before as some kind of "spiritual journey". It doesn't convince.</review>
<review>Ellen Page, who has a manic energy here that she's not shown before... Her too-brief time on screen energizes the film</review>
<review>Gunn seems unable to decide whether he's making a satirical work or a sick joke and, as a result, he squanders the entertainingly unhinged performances of his cast before copping out with a sentimental happy ending.</review>
<review>This disastrously unfunny superhero spoof features a grating performance from Juno star Ellen Page, a vapid leading man in Rainn Wilson and an idiotic mix of humour and violence.</review>
<review>An atonal mix of knockabout humour and out-of-nowhere violence that's so utterly wrong, it might actually challenge The Day The Clown Cried, Jerry Lewis's unfinished and unreleased 1972 Holocaust comedy.</review>
<review>Thanks to Wilson's ridiculously nerdish ambition, and a lively performance from Page, there are laughs to be had, but it could have been a funnier parody.</review>
<review>Writer-director James Gunn eventually loses control of the tone, which slips from deadpan to deadly and trashes what little amusement there was in a finale of gruesome violence.</review>
<review>Some really interesting ideas and the odd flash of awesomeness, but overall a big old misfire with some ill-judged nastiness.</review>
<review>As black comedy, it works reasonably well some of the time, with plenty of black but not much comedy.</review>

<score>47</score>
<MovieInfo>A satire of comic-book superheroes in the same vein as the 1999 Mystery Men, The Specials is set in a parallel universe where gangs of superheroes regularly compete against one another for glory or, failing that, flattering action-figure likenesses. The Specials are one of these gangs, and not a very good one at that. Composed of the Weevil (Rob Lowe), the group's most popular member, Amok (Jamie Kennedy), a potty-mouthed shape-shifter, group leader Strobe (Thomas Haden Church), and the constantly growing or shrinking Minute Man (James Gunn), the Specials are more concerned with their image than in actually doing anything heroic. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<review>Very funny, Well worth a look</review>
<review>It's such a low key parody that the undercurrent of deadpan nuttiness and sheer invention just sneaks up on you.</review>
<review>Surprisingly amusing super-hero satire. Combine this flick with "Mystery Men" and you'd have a classic.</review>
<review>...generally emphasizes jokes that aren't all that funny...</review>
<review>More amusing when taken by moments than as a whole...</review>
<review>A idéia é genial, mas o roteiro jamais aproveita a premissa. Além disso, a direção é simplesmente péssima e o baixo orçamento não permite que vejamos os superpoderes dos heróis.</review>
<review>Better than most superhero flicks to come down the pike. I assure you, this will achieve underground cult status one day.</review>

<name>Special</name>
<score>57</score>
<MovieInfo>An unremarkable parking-enforcement officer living a low-key existence of solitary lunches in the park, lonely dinners at home, and superhero comics that at least afford him the quiet release of fantasy enrolls into a clinical trial for antidepressant pills, only to find that it has some decidedly unexpected side effects, in directors Hal Haberman and Jeremy Passmore's quirky comic-book superhero comedy. Les Franken (Michael Rappaport) leads an unassuming life that rarely deviates from a strict regiment of working, eating, sleeping, and comic book reading. His only two friends are a pair of stoners who own a local comic shop, so Les determines to shake things up a bit by volunteering as a test subject for an experimental drug designed to curb depression. When the drug appears to give Les special powers, the doctor in charge of the clinical controlled test insists that Les is simply experiencing an unanticipated psychological reaction to the medication. But Les is convinced that his powers are genuine, and as he ditches his work uniform in favor of more superhero-appropriate threads, he is about to find out once and for all whether he truly is able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, or his depression, combined with the strange side-effects of the drug, has somehow propelled his superhero fantasies to the forefront of his damaged psyche. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<review>Special offers a unique spin on the superhero template but rarely soars beyond its sly premise.</review>
<review>The quiet-yet-hip tone of the film reminded me a lot of Roger Dodger, another indie film that let's its script and acting do the talking.</review>
<review>Eccentric, depressing thriller won't grab teens' attention.</review>
<review>Special works as an honest portrait of little people with big dreams even if it remains itself a little movie without a big impact.</review>
<review>I just thought it was a cool indie film with a great leading performance from an actor we don't usually get to see in a lead.</review>
<review>The premise is intriguing, and the film is occasionally amusing, but it feels stuck between a completely satirical farce and an aching drama.</review>
<review>The sight of him, bloodied but eternally unbowed, in his ridiculous, homemade superhero costume may indeed be totally iconic for true pulp believers.</review>
<review>Take[s] a page from the cartoonist Bill Watterson, who noted of the tiger protagonist in his great Calvin &amp; Hobbes, 'The nature of [the character's] reality doesn't interest me, and each story goes out of its way to avoid resolving the issue.'</review>
<review>Rappaport does a yeoman's job in this tonally confused oddity.</review>
<review>It may not be perfect, but this under-the-radar indie from Hal Haberman and Jeremy Passmore is smart enough to leave you glad you found it.</review>
<review>Ultimately it adds little to our understanding of the curious return of the superhero as our paradigmatic pop archetype.</review>
<review>Shot for pennies -- a cash limitation that benefits the production's creativity and credibility -- this haunting film keeps shifting the ground under our feet</review>
<review>A beautiful metaphor for the desperate need to be important in a world where we rarely make personal connections any more, Special deserves to be seen.</review>
<review>What begins as a mildly amusing indie lark descends into a depressingly unappealing exercise in mico-budget filmmaking.</review>
<review>Its ambitions are limited -- though at 81 minutes, wisely proportioned -- but its heart is in the right place.</review>
<review>A great genre film dissects authentic problems without attempting to supplant them. Reasonably enough, Special belongs to that category with the rest of Magnet's Six Shooter Series.</review>
<review>Special is an inexplicable downer that favors pathos over satire.</review>
<review>Thanks to Rapaport's brio in embracing the hero's drug-induced delusions, the movie is less a failure than a noble experiment gone awry.</review>
<review>Rappaport's befuddled sincerity has never registered so poignantly, but given its singular premise, for the film to waste an easy opportunity to satirize vigilante do-goodery and pharmaceutical dependence is, well, villainous.</review>
<review>This fantasy battle between good and evil is merely a cute, minor idea with little depth and even less conscious purpose, fit for a 15-minute short rather than a feature-length narrative.</review>

<name>Orgazmo</name>
<score>47</score>
<MovieInfo>Trey Parker, creator of the TV series South Park, wrote, directed, and stars in this cheerfully vulgar comedy. Joe Young (Parker) is a devout Mormon living in L.A. trying to raise enough money to go back to Utah and marry his girlfriend, Lisa (Robyn Lynne Raab). Joe is spreading the word about the church of Latter Day Saints one day when he's confronted by two burly bodyguards. A scuffle breaks out, and Joe's martial arts skills impress Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs), who directs pornographic movies. Maxxx offers Joe 20,000 dollars to star in his latest skin flick as X-rated superhero Captain Orgazmo. While Joe is wary, he agrees under the condition that a body double is used during the sex scenes. Ben Chapleski (Dian Bachar), who plays the good captain's sidekick, Choda-Boy, has invented a real-life version of Orgazmo's secret weapon, a gun that stuns people with spasms of sexual ecstasy. When Joe and Ben learn that Maxxx is involved in organized crime, they leap into action to see that justice is served. Meanwhile, their film becomes a surprise crossover success, which means that Joe has a lot of explaining to do to Lisa. Trey Parker cast Orgazmo with a number of real-life adult film stars, including Ron Jeremy, Julie Ashton, and Chasey Lain. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi NC-17,</MovieInfo>

<review>A strenuous effort to be an inventive comedy with perversely wicked humor, this midnight movie (premiering at Toronto Fest) showcases the talents of Trey Parker as writer-director-star; hopefully, his next film will be more successful</review>
<review>loads of fund</review>
<review>Parker and Stone are about to take over your funny bone.....A unique, amusing pic</review>
<review>If you're already a fan, consider the Special Edition DVD a must-own; if you've never seen Orgazmo before, be sure to make it a rental first. And hide the kiddies.</review>
<review>Stupid but also sharply funny.</review>
<review>The best movie about a Mormon porn star ever made.</review>
<review>.. and his sidekick, Choda Boy!</review>
<review>Perhaps the movie's single biggest joke is its NC-17 rating, which it must have earned solely for raunchy dialogue. The nudity is anything but erotic.</review>
<review>A film that isn't as funny as it should be, but should have been seen by more people.</review>
<review>This movie confirms Trey Parker as the Orson Welles of absurd comedy.</review>

<name>South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut</name>
<score>81</score>
<MovieInfo>The most tasteless third graders on television graduate to the big screen, as Trey Parker and Matt Stone expand their animated series with foul-mouthed humor that might breach the boundaries of basic cable. In the small Colorado town of South Park, good-natured Stan Marsh, slightly neurotic Kyle Broflovski, fat and petulant Eric Cartman, and perpetually doomed Kenny McCormick are psyched for the premiere of the first feature film from flatulent Canadian TV performers Terrance and Phillip, entitled "Asses of Fire." The movie is rated R, but that's not about to stop the boys from sneaking into the theater. However, when the boys' language gets bluer by the minute after seeing the film, their parents and school administrators decide that something must be done. Kyle's mother comes up with the ideal solution: blame Canada. Terrance and Phillip end up in jail for corrupting America's youth, while the Canadian Air Force retaliates with an air strike targeting the Baldwin brothers. The boys soon organize a children's underground resistance force to free Terrance and Phillip before they can be executed; meanwhile, in a sensitive subplot exploring relationship issues, we're permitted an inside look at the domestic problems of Satan and his lover, Saddam Hussein. As on the TV show, Parker and Stone perform the voices of most of the characters, and they also wrote several songs for the film; George Clooney, Minnie Driver, Eric Idle, Dave Foley, and Mike Judge contribute voices. Not to spoil the plot, but rumor has it that Kenny dies. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<review>Possibly the single most subversive fact about the film is that all else being equal, it's one of the best original movie musicals in a generation.</review>
<review>Entertaining raunchfest; not for kids.</review>
<review>Manages to be both amazingly stupid and clever at the same time.</review>
<review>Both hysterically funny and frighteningly pertinent...</review>
<review>Nastier than it is subversive or funny.</review>
<review>[An] inspired, self-referential animated musical.</review>
<review>Among other things, the South Park movie restores the happy shock and exuberance of talking dirty.</review>
<review>This movie is nasty, shocking, hilarious, and close to brilliant.</review>
<review>Genuinely outrageous and sometimes hilarious -- but size does eventually matter, and all-rounder Trey Parker just can't keep it up for the full 81 minutes.</review>
<review>If, like me, you're sick of every work of art getting judged by your grandmother's delicate sensibilities and would like to watch some real artists have some fun while flipping off the cultural watchdogs, this film was made for you.</review>
<review>Tous les fans se régaleront de ce film tout à fait réussi.</review>
<review>It's savagely funny, it's true to the core essence of the show, and it expands on the show in ways that television, due to content restrictions and time limitations, simply couldn't allow. And the tunes rock.</review>
<review>It fails miserably.</review>
<review>Like listening to a profane rant by kids stricken with Tourette's syndrome.</review>
<review>Vulgar and tasteless as usual, but most definitely longer and, quite obviously, to its detriment, uncut.</review>
<review>It will offend a lot of people who need to be offended once in a while.</review>
<review>I found this film hysterically funny and quite thought-provoking.</review>
<review>South Park finds jokes where you cannot possibly expect them and leavens the grossness not with a brain-dead love story but a spirited, smart enough look at its own inspired prurience.</review>
<review>Rude, but inspired.</review>
<review>Inspired, brilliant filmmaking and one of the most scathing satires to come along in some time.</review>

<name>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</name>
<score>54</score>
<MovieInfo>The frequently recurring title characters, employed by writer and director Kevin Smith as supporting players in several of his films, are put to rest with this comedy that focuses on them exclusively. Jay (Jason Mews) and Silent Bob (Smith) are a pair of stoned New Jersey slackers who have long been used as the templates for a pair of popular comic book heroes, Bluntman and Chronic. When they learn that their alter egos are to be turned into a major motion picture without their consent or compensation, the pair sets off for Hollywood to sabotage the production. Along the way, they encounter an ape, a nun (Carrie Fisher), the cast of Scooby-Doo, a Charlie's Angels-style band of sexy women who use them as stool pigeons in a diamond heist, and an unhinged wildlife ranger (Will Ferrell). They also meet up with some regulars from the Smith canon, including Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), Brian O'Halloran as Dante Hicks, Jason Lee as Banky Edwards, Alanis Morissette as God, and actors Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in dual roles as themselves and two other familiar characters. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back co-stars numerous other recognizable performers in roles of various sizes, including Shannen Doherty, Jason Biggs, James Van Der Beek, Shannon Elizabeth, Tracy Morgan, Judd Nelson, Chris Rock, and George Carlin, among others. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<review>Kevin Smith fans will enjoy. Not for kids.</review>
<review>The epitome of self indulgence.</review>
<review>Like one massive inside joke that only regulars to the View Askew Universe will get, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is the ultimate measure of Smith's undeniable nerdiness.</review>
<review>I was surprised to discover that I really liked this film...</review>
<review>Has the lazy, bric-a-brac atmosphere of one of those blown-off movies made during down time on some bigger affair.</review>
<review>A mess, yes, but a funny and highly enjoyable one.</review>
<review>I have no idea how it'll play for people unfamiliar with Smith's work, but I rolled with it.</review>
<review>The film feels like a download of Mr. Smith's brain.</review>
<review>Tune out the dreck and there are enough laughs for it to be worthwhile.</review>
<review>What do you want, some meditation on the human condition?</review>
<review>The perfect curtain call for these much-loved, wise but oh so stupid slackers.</review>
<review>I feel a strange disturbance in the Force.</review>
<review>While that may be enough for teenage fans, anyone expecting more will be sorely disappointed.</review>
<review>...a madcap comedy that rarely disappoints.</review>
<review>Along with CLERKS, it makes a nice bookend to [Kevin] Smith's Jersey chronicles</review>
<review>If not a masterpiece of thespianism, it's at least a fun ride through Smith's quirky mind and the lives of his unique characters.</review>
<review>There's an awful lot to enjoy here, even if you're not a hardcore Smith fan.</review>
<review>Long live Jay and Silent Bob!</review>
<review>At some point, irreverence and wit notwithstanding, enough is enough.</review>
<review>Mewes is a strangely compelling lead, and that in itself is good reason enough to see the film. That is, if the fact that this is the funniest movie of the year hasn't convinced you yet!</review>

<name>Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle</name>
<score>74</score>
<MovieInfo>Directed by Danny Leiner, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle follows the life-changing (and mind-altering) journey of Korean-American investment banker Harold (John Cho) and Indian-American medical-school candidate Kumar (Kal Penn). Both underdogs, Harold and Kumar decide to spend what would have been an otherwise uneventful Friday night satisfying an oddly intense urge for White Castle hamburgers. However, finding a White Castle proves a highly difficult task, and the two friends wind up on an epic road trip of deep thoughts, deeper inhaling, and enough half-baked, politically incorrect philosophizing to outweigh a White Castle value meal. ~ Tracie Cooper, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<review>Extremely dumb and vulgar comedy; not for kids.</review>
<review>You'll laugh, you'll laugh, and you'll laugh%u2014especially if you see the movie in the cannabis enhanced glaze that the filmmakers intend.</review>
<review>'This night is about the American dream,' Kumar promises, and you know what? It sort of is. [Blu-Ray]</review>
<review>...for all its juvenile shortcomings, there's a sweet and beguiling charm to the film.</review>
<review>A deserving modern classic, even if only for being so bold as to describe Katie Holmes' breasts as being "the exact opposite" of the Holocaust.</review>
<review>...fares a whole lot better than the majority of its stoner-comedy brethren...</review>
<review>An over-the-top romp which rehashes lots of dumb drug jokes but breaks far enough away from the tried-and-true teen formula to earn a high mark even from this jaded critic.</review>
<review>A multilayered goof on ethnic stereotypes...</review>
<review>a whacky, racially refreshing breather in Hollywood's white-dominated, politically over-correct bummer of a mainstream culture</review>
<review>Go ahead, it's what you crave.</review>
<review>While unabashedly unsophisticated, this flick is subtly smarter, more audacious and more finely tuned than other movies of its ilk...</review>
<review>Warm, crazily inventive and sometimes hysterical...</review>
<review>Behind all the Farrelly-esque gross-out humour and Cheech &amp; Chong-isms lies a sensitive little picture with a deftly handled anti-racism slant.</review>
<review>It's all as serious as a White Castle slider.</review>
<review>...this film is dreadful! Horrible! Terrible! Aaaarrggghhh!</review>
<review>Funny and brave; it's tradition with a refreshing new twist.</review>
<review>Frankly, if there isn't already another Harold and Kumar movie in the works, then there should be.</review>
<review>Will never become a teen classic, to be remembered lovingly as the film that shaped your teenage years but one thing's for sure: it's very funny and wonderfully dumb.</review>
<review>There's an audience that will appreciate this, but they may struggle to see it through the smoke.</review>
<review>Director Danny Leiner has now elevated the stoner comedy to its highest peak...</review>

<review>Raunchy and unfunny, this sequel feels like a simple retread of its predecessor.</review>
<review>If you love the first film, seriously, do not see this one. You'll ruin two movies at once.</review>
<review>The cast is once again at the top of their game and there are some genuinely hilarious moments, but on the whole, The Hangover Part II is way too similar to the first film to be enjoyable.</review>
<review>The Hangover: Part II shows the writers have absolutely no faith in their characters or their own ability to take them somewhere new.</review>
<review>Overall, your enjoyment of this film will correlate directly to your enjoyment of the previous film. If you liked it, you'll like this one, if not, you won't enjoy the sequel as it's just more of the same.</review>
<review>I think the first one is like GONE WITH THE WIND compared to this tired old turd.</review>
<review>Visually dazzling, well shot and perhaps richer in character than the first film -- but also nowhere near as clever, refreshing or funny.</review>
<review>It is the epitome of lazy Hollywood filmmaking.</review>
<review>There are one or two good jokes and the cast is mainly likeable but the rest of the material is so predictable and tawdry that the entire film becomes something of a chore</review>
<review>...almost the same gang of dimwits are up to the same shenanigans, with Thailand substituting for Vegas.</review>
<review>The guys are just as clueless after a wild night on the town, but getting lost amid the goggle-bright lights of Las Vegas seems like a fairground ride compared to Bangkok.</review>
<review>One drink too many, The Hangover Part II relies too much on its talented cast and not enough on the laughs.</review>
<review>This is not a case of imitation being the sincerest form of flattery-it is indolent narcissism of the most nauseating kind.</review>
<review>More a horror than a comedic film, as if Todd Phillips is making a kind of "Heart of Darkness" argument with Bangkok as his backdrop.</review>
<review>If you can look past the fact that this film is closer to a remake than a sequel, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. Might not be original, but it's still funny.</review>
<review>...as needless a contemporary sequel as one can easily recall...</review>
<review>It might not be quite as much fun as the first film but it's fun enough - and that's all that counts. Plus, there's a monkey in it.</review>
<review>"It happened again." That's the opening gambit of The Hangover: Part II, but sadly the same can be said of the franchise.</review>
<review>If you liked The Hangover, you're going to like The Hangover Part II because it is the same movie.</review>
<review>Hangover 2 far too Familiar</review>

<MovieInfo>When a one-night stand that should have stayed that way has unexpected consequences, the reluctant odd couple attempts to transform their tentative relationship into a lasting love in this conception comedy. Twenty-four-year-old entertainment journalist Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is on the fast track to the big time, but an alcohol-fueled hookup with responsibility-shirking slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) finds her professional priorities taking a back seat to having a baby. Now, as overgrown kid Ben attempts to assume the responsibilities of fatherhood, he makes the brave decision to stand by Alison. In order to make things work between the pair, however, there's going to have to be some compromise, and when Alison and Ben decide to take a shot at love, they quickly find that building a relationship from scratch isn't nearly as easy as making a baby. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>With sparkling performances from Rogen and Heigl, Apatow once again shows his sharp eye for talent and continuing knack for hits.</review>
<review>The jokes, which are in the absolute poorest taste, remain hilarious, while a newer, deeper humanism, sensed in momentary flashes in the earlier film, is now fully on display.</review>
<review>The movie is a decisive breakthrough for Apatow, whose comic instincts go hand in hand with an unfashionable empathy.</review>
<review>It's a hysterical, well acted, and wonderful glimpse at impending parenthood from a man's perspective...</review>
<review>It's a movie with heart and with balls, and it knows when to use each of them.</review>
<review>If Apatow was seeking to make a film that's smutty and funny, but also romantic and realistic about relationships, he's succeeded admirably.</review>
<review>It's the funniest, smartest, goofiest, dirtiest, coolest (and longest -- over two hours, in fact) comedy so far this year.</review>
<review>Knocked Up is possibly the best comedy of the year.</review>
<review>A surprisingly sincere look at male-female Mars-Venusness in these 00s. It's funny alright, but not in the way you might think.</review>
<review>Apatow's cockeyed Citizen Kane, merging goofball, pothead jokes with a plausible story of unshakable relationship discomfort; a broad mismatch of personalities and body shapes glued together by the cruelty of insemination.</review>
<review>Interesting blend of frat-house smarm and emotional incisiveness</review>
<review>The film seethes with misdirected and unrecognized anger.</review>
<review>Knocked Up is like a Hallmark Greeting Card with crude verse. It's is an uneasy mix of ethnic humor, slacker humor, and human drama -- some is amusing, some is indulgent, and some is strained.</review>
<review>A pleasant enough comedy that doesn't take the "gross out" too far and presents a complex, if egotistical view of pregnancy and responsibility.</review>
<review>Apatow simply knows funny when he sees it, and he gives his actors' ample opportunity to plumb all possible comic depths.</review>
<review>Knocked Up really comes alive when it has something to say about the thorny responsibilities -- and unexpected blessings -- of adult relationships.</review>
<review>For all its avowed interest in life -- as in, you know, the biological imperatives of our existence -- its characters seem acquainted only with television.</review>
<review>Apatow's talent for accurately portraying his generation at their most self-absorbed doesn't quite go as far at justifying the script's patchy, haphazard conflicts at it does toward explaining the film's bloated running time.</review>
<review>everything about it is great</review>

<review>The screenplay is written by three females, who write women like they hate them and men like they've never met a real one.</review>
<review>The ugly truth about this film is that it may convince males out there that it's okay to be a pig.</review>
<review>[It] attempts to be hip and edgy by featuring plenty of discussions about boy parts and girl parts and how they become friends with one another. However, the makers of this film clearly have no idea about how men and women actually interact.</review>
<review>If all you need is a fix of puerile smut and puddle-deep romantic giggles and can't wait for the next episode of Two and a Half Men, The Ugly Truth should do the trick.</review>
<review>The Ugly Truth has all the honesty and romance of an Axe body spray commercial.</review>
<review>...there's no finesse or scarcity to lend impact to the vulgarity. It's handled with all the craftsmanship of an infant wielding an arc welder.</review>
<review>A putative romantic comedy about the fundamental differences between men and women, it reduces both genders to emotional cripples while failing to find any humor in the situation.</review>
<review>...a mildly diverting yet thoroughly uninvolving romantic comedy...</review>
<review>click for the full review</review>
<review>As a girls'-night-out movie for those in the right frame of mind, it gets some laughs, even a few big ones. But this opposites-attract comedy is wildly uneven: There are long stretches of down time, and some of the humor is so crude it backfires.</review>
<review>Apparently, the ugly truth is that neither sex needs or deserves respect. How romantic. The 'Sex and the City' gals would be proud.</review>
<review>Formula can be fun, as it is here.</review>
<review>This lackluster, stereotypical movie attempts to update its shopworn formula with a stream of four letter words and sexually crude phrases in Judd Apatow fashion but ends up turning off everyone in the process.</review>
<review>Allowing the characters to talk dirty adds nothing to the chick flick formula.</review>
<review>THE UGLY TRUTH isn't as painfully predictable as THE PROPOSAL, and it's funnier too. That doesn't mean it's a complete success. I never really wanted the two leads to end up with each other, and the transition in which they fall in love is clunky.</review>
<review>Yet another wearying "battle-of-the-sexes" romp that's sure to please dumb people but didn't please me.</review>
<review>Daring and dirty, making it so delicious.</review>
<review>Heigl is said to have fallen out with Apatow since the making of Knocked Up. Maybe she should reconnect with him.</review>
<review>Ugly can't Describe the Truth about this Film</review>
<review>It's hard to believe the script is attributed to three women, because this could send the Women's Movement back sixty years.</review>

<review>He's Just Not That Into You is just insultingly average in every way, spending 129 minutes telling us what we already know: girls and boys don't always click.</review>
<review>Your men folk will be bored out of their minds but you've dragged them to worse. It tries hard anyway. And since the whole thing is about advice on men let me give some; never take relationship advice from Candace Bushnell.</review>
<review>He's Just Not That Into You wishes it were Love, Actually crossed with The Break-Up, but it plays more like a horror movie for the WASP set.</review>
<review>Works as an hour episode of Oprah or a thirty-minute episode of Sex and the City, but as a full length movie -- I'm just not that into it.</review>
<review>Everyone pitches in, but it isn't enough to rescue a tedious, fragmented, scattershot script.</review>
<review>A how-to happy ending training manual for aspiring female objects of desire, while movies about men have to do with the really big challenges they face, like beating up alien invaders or saving the planet. Doormat duty alert: She's Just Not That Onto You.</review>
<review>Despite some definite tendencies toward the formulaic, He's Just Not That Into You actually has half a brain in its head.</review>
<review>It's really a relationship comedy more than a romantic comedy, since a lot of the film is concerned with demonstrating when one should walk away, rather than when to lean in for the kiss and cleave.</review>
<review>I romantiki gkomenti, poy paei tis romantikes gkomenti se nea epipeda prosbolis ton hazogkomenon poy trabaei ap' ti myti os target group</review>
<review>This voyeuristic escapist fare offers a mixed bag of goodies.</review>
<review>People often do stupid things for love. That doesn't mean it's worth making a movie about these acts of folly.</review>
<review>He's Just Not That Into You is a standard chick flick, which isn't necessarily a bad thing: it's cute and comic and organized according to fixed, mostly ancient gender roles.</review>
<review>Tangles its large cast of characters and storylines into virtual knots.</review>
<review>Distinctly overlong yet ultimately rewarding...</review>
<review>Boasts a lot of heart, humor, and honesty.</review>
<review>Despite a final surge of romantic sweetness, it's just not funny or engaging</review>
<review>Though the actors involved are mostly major players, the material they've been given to work with is very old hat.</review>
<review>Clever one-liners and a screenplay that doesn't try too hard to be poignant or contrived make for an easy-going film that will lead to interesting post-movie discussion.</review>
<review>He's Just Not That Into You is like reliving your 20s, without any of the fun.</review>
<review>I thought there was a level of sophistication in the relationships that I certainly did not expect.</review>

<MovieInfo>The best-seller by sentimental novelist Nicholas Sparks becomes this teen melodrama set in a coastal North Carolina port. Cocky, popular high school student Landon Carter (Shane West) is the big man on campus at Beaufort High School until a hazing incident leaves a fellow student paralyzed. Sentenced to community service and membership in his school's drama club, Landon is forced to seek help from Jamie Sullivan (pop singer Mandy Moore), the conservative, religious, plain-Jane daughter of the town's Baptist minister (Peter Coyote). When the two students begin to fall in love, Landon struggles with the drop in popularity that his new friendship brings, while Jamie is forced to deal with her strict father and a secret that she's keeping from her schoolmates. A Walk to Remember, which co-stars Daryl Hannah, is the second of Sparks's novels to make it to the big screen after Message in a Bottle (1999). ~ Karl Williams, Rovi PG,</MovieInfo>

<review>'No one was expecting Remains of the Day but this film could have been more than just a Dawson's Creek stop gap.'</review>
<review>Wholly un-groundbreaking, deeply conservative, increasingly sentimental, but reflecting some of the best of those qualities.</review>
<review>This horrific teen romance-cum-weepie is best watched from between your fingers, or from under your seat, or perhaps standing outside the cinema looking in the opposite direction.</review>
<review>Director Shankman ditches character development in favour of delivering an exploitative date movie and dubiously conservative moral lesson.</review>
<review>Mandy Moore only has herself to blame for choosing such a tooth-rottingly sentimental weepie as this.</review>
<review>Seeing as how it's based on a weepy Nicholas Sparks novel, it's not surprising that this teen romantic drama is an almost unbearably weepy film.</review>

<score>79</score>
<MovieInfo>Following his surprise-hit American remake of The Ring in 2002, director Gore Verbinski took on Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, the second of recent films to be based upon Disney theme-park rides (the first being The Country Bears). When Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the daughter of Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce) is kidnapped by a group of pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and taken aboard their ship, The Black Pearl, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the young man who loves Elizabeth despite the fact that she is promised to another, sets out to rescue her. But he can't do it alone, so he enlists the help of swashbuckling ship captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together the two chase after The Black Pearl, but they soon discover that the captain and crew aren't your average pirates. Cursed to remain between the living and the dead, Barbossa and his men look like skeletons when basked in the moonlight. When it is revealed that the only thing that can break the curse is Elizabeth's blood, Jack and Will are faced with a race against time and a battle against the undead to save the Governor's daughter. ~ Matthew Tobey, Rovi PG-13,</MovieInfo>

<review>Rip-roaring fun for kids who don't mind skeletons.</review>
<review>Entertaining, exciting, and engrossing with a genuine feel of adventure along with excellent performances, this is truly worth watching.</review>
<review>Were it not for Johnny Depp's crassly reassured character creation of scoundrel pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, there would be nothing to relish in this overlong and witless waste of celluloid based on a Disneyland ride.</review>
<review>It's just a lot of fun.</review>
<review>one of the all time greatest adventure flicks</review>
<review>Here -- in a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced high-seas adventure that incorporates roaring cannons, oddball comedy, a love story and more than a touch of the supernatural -- Depp unleashes his theatrical bravado. He's hilarious.</review>
<review>Oops, there I go again talking about Johnny Depp. Get used to that. He's all you'll remember from the movie.</review>
<review>The whole feature film is one giant ride -- which considering its origins is perhaps to be expected. ... Depp gives his loosest and looniest performance yet -- and it is spectacular.</review>
<review>Depp invests this overfed, action-tractioned swashbuckler with a voluptuous wit and spry spontaneity it surely doesn't deserve.</review>
<review>Pirates of the Caribbean is exactly what you look for in a summer blockbuster, all while delivering a much-needed overhaul to the classic pirate flicks of the golden years.</review>
<review>Depp's highly strange, oddly magnetic, and irresistibly entertaining performance energizes the overextended, two-hour-plus proceedings.</review>
<review>It echoes the ambition, mischief, boyish glee, and whimsical wit of 80s adventure films like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Gremlins, The Goonies, and The Princess Bride....</review>
<review>If you think the title is long, wait until you see the movie.</review>
<review>Tthe real surprise here is how strong the writing holds up.</review>
<review>Comes close to recreating some of the bigger-than-life wonder that we experience at the movies in our childhood. Depp is a fey, hilarious wonder.</review>
<review>May cause you to sing "Yo, ho-ho and a bottle of rum" and shout phrases such as "Tie the scurvy dogs to the yardarm" just for the fun of it.</review>
<review>It's a rare thing when I come out of a movie theater these days saying the words, 'Geez, I hope they do a sequel to this thing.'</review>
<review>Depp is wonderful here, and Sparrrow is the best creation of the movie year.</review>
<review>...Full of colorful visuals, amazing special effects, and plenty of silly fun for the whole family.</review>
<review>Both kids and adults will thoroughly enjoy this movie. It's a lot of fun and well worth checking out. I highly recommend checking it out on the big screen.</review>

<reviews>
<review>Precisely the movie this series should be producing now, a generic, harmless spectacle with the added bonus of Johnny Depp goofing off.</review>
<review>A movie so dark, dank and devoid of coherence that you'd swear it exists only to pillage gullible buckos of their bucks.</review>
<review>Great production design and a couple well done action scenes make this one somewhat enjoyable.</review>
<review>Competent, but joyless.</review>
<review>There is fun to be had and it's exciting (for a moment) to see Captain Jack Sparrow on the big screen again but the overall production suffers from franchise burnout.</review>
<review>The action ... ranges from fun swashbuckling, to tedious parrying, to outright terribly edited, CGI funk that completely defies any kind of physical presence.</review>
<review>"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" is not really a bad film, it's more so a disappointing and forgettable one</review>
<review>... continues not only the tale of (the Sparrow and Barbossa) rivalry but also why (and how well) they ever worked together to begin with.</review>
<review>By the end of the film you get the feeling that Depp himself is wondering just how much longer he can fake the funk for a paycheck.</review>
<review>Captain Jack Sparrow is running on fumes in this enjoyable, but middling, forgettable sequel.</review>
<review>It's not as bad as everyone says. It's just missing the playfulness of the first two films.</review>
<review>If it had been cut to about 90 minutes, this could have been a bright and breezy adventure that zipped along at a cracking pace. As it is, it's a rather bloated actioner that has one or two great moments.</review>
<review>You know the old saying 'less is more?' I present to you exhibit A: 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.'</review>
<review>Continues to steer the same course as its predecessor sequels, focusing on convoluted storylines that zap all the fun and energy that made the first film so great.</review>
<review>An unsteady plot and mostly juvenile humor take over for much of the film's 137 minutes, which though blessedly shorter than installments two and three still feels a little long.</review>
<review>Director Rob Marshall stages slapstick like dance choreography and action like a theme park ride. Which I guess is appropriate...</review>
<review>After four movies, Pirates is beginning to feel a bit like a soggy, waterlogged plank that's been afloat in the salty sea a bit too long.</review>
<review>Saying that less is more with reference to a film that vomits so much over its audience is absurd yet oddly appropriate here.</review>
<review>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides suffers from an extraordinary lack of imagination, something that cannot be said of its predecessors, convoluted and impenetrable though they may have certainly been.</review>
<review>Disney-sanitizer wafts through--there are few bloody, mercenary moments. Some action sequences are cartoonish. And for such a talky picture, the dialogue's not charged enough.</review>

<name>Mutiny on the Bounty</name>
<score>71</score>
<MovieInfo>This colorful remake of the 1935 version again concerns the crew and treatment of the HMS Bounty by a cold hearted sadistic captain. Captain Bligh (Trevor Howard) boards the ship in Portsmouth, England, to embark on a mission to bring tropical breadfruit trees to Jamaica. Fletcher Christian (Marlon Brando) is the aristocratic second mate who welcomes the new captain aboard. Christian's view of the captain sours with the cruel treatment of the crew and the dangerous decision to round Cape Horn. The Bounty sails into the teeth of a ferocious winter storm which is another in a long line of indignities suffered on the journey. John Mills (Richard Harris) is punished for stealing cheese. A sailor is ordered to stay aloft in the crow's nest, nearly resulting in death. The crew finds temporary paradise in Tahiti before Bligh's behavior becomes intolerable for the once faithful Christian. The crew revolts and sends the captain on his way in a small rowboat. Settling on Pitcairn Island, the crew soon realizes they may never see England again. Mills burns the ship to insure the trip is never made. Christian attempts to save the only means of transportation of their new island home. Lewis Milestone directed the film which was plagued by constant cost overruns to the tune of 18 million dollars. Brando's legendary ego clashed with results as turbulent as the fictitious trip around stormy Cape Horn. The movie retained slightly over half the cost of the production price tag in its initial release. ~ Dan Pavlides, Rovi Unrated,</MovieInfo>

<review>It's best to watch it for its glorious cinematography and settings, and forget about Brando's participation.</review>
<review>A troubled production, with clashes between Brando and the original director, technical problems, but despite all that, the movie has some good moments.</review>
<review>With Clark Gable's recent death creating an awareness and an expectation in moviegoers of 1962 for a robust and manly Gable characterization, instead Brando delivered a nasally, aristocratic poseur</review>
<review>Brando makes a total mess of his English accent, the romantic interlude in Tahiti goes on endlessly, and the visuals (perhaps the main point of interest in the movie) too often resort to travelogue vistas and picture postcard lighting.</review>
<review>...Marlon Brando makes Fletcher Christian an eccentric who dominates the entire dramatic scheme.</review>
<review>Its picture postcard scenery couldn't hide how colorless the film felt at times.</review>
<review>Brando is plainly miscast...</review>

Thadeous (McBride) has spent his life watching his perfect older brother Fabious (Franco) embark upon valiant journeys and win the hearts of his people. Tired of being passed over for adventure, adoration and the throne, he's settled for a life of wizard's weed, hard booze and easy maidens. But when Fabious' bride-to-be, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel), gets kidnapped by the evil wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux), the king gives his deadbeat son an ultimatum: Man up and help rescue her or get cut off. Half-assedly embarking upon his first quest, Thadeous joins Fabious to trek across the perilous outlands and free the princess. Joined by Isabel (Natalie Portman)--an elusive warrior with a dangerous agenda of her own--the brothers must vanquish horrific creatures and traitorous knights before they can reach Belladonna. If Thadeous can find his inner hero, he can help his brother prevent the destruction of his land. Stay a slacker, and not only does he die a coward, he gets front row seats to the dawn of an all-new Dark Ages. -- (C) Universal R,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>The only saving grace of this film is the cast, which includes some fantastic actors, slumming it for a paycheck.</review>
<review>This is teenage junk trash rendered lovingly. I see no problem with that. And if I ever kill a minotaur, I know what I'm taking as a trophy.</review>
<review>Your Highness never sacrifices its cheerful, one-thing-after-another absurdity, or its inability to take itself even remotely seriously.</review>
<review>Your Highness hits more than it misses but the effort is substantially lacking, which particularly unexpected considering the gifted people involved.</review>
<review>Quite a comedown and a buzz kill, after "Pineapple Express."</review>
<review>Director David Gordon Green and writers Danny McBride and Ben Best have put together a completely unfunny film filled to the brim with non-stop sexual references and other bits of lowbrow humor.</review>
<review>It's time for Green to make one of the moody, downbeat, haunting indie dramas with which he initially made a name for himself.</review>
<review>If Green wanted to make an awesome fantasy film, he should have, and if he wanted to make a great stoner comedy, well, he already did once.</review>
<review>A surprisingly boring throwback to '80s fantasy, with a disgusting amount of potty humor, violence and foul language tossed in to generate the shallowest of laughs.</review>
<review>There are glimmers of inspired comedy, but rather than explore the genre's stereotypes, the movie constantly falls back on smut.</review>
<review>A spirited and (mostly) funny genre spoof from the same team responsible for Pineapple Express.</review>
<review>Who could have possibly thought any of this is funny?</review>
<review>Just don't expect too much from it and remember to switch off your brain.</review>
<review>McBride, who also created the indelible character of Kenny Powers on HBO's "Eastbound and Down," has most of the good lines and he makes the most of them</review>
<review>In theory, I suppose it would be funny-and incongruous-if in the middle of a serious costume drama a noble action hero uttered a four-letter word. Hearing Danny McBride do just that, repeatedly, in Your Highness not only isn't funny but grows wearisome...</review>
<review>In case you miss the joke, McBride helpfully arcs an eyebrow and cocks his head to signal the punchline. And with all the subtlety of Thor, he hammers most of his crude one-liners in the direction of Portman as the vengeful warrior chick Isabel.</review>
<review>Good fun.</review>
<review>...boasts a pervasively absurd atmosphere that's heightened on an all-too-frequent basis by the almost uniformly over-the-top performances.</review>
<review>I found myself laughing a lot at this rotten movie.</review>
<review>I love McBride and Franco and will watch them in anything -- it's a bonus that there are corsets and scary labyrinths.</review>

<name>Land of the Lost</name>
<score>26</score>
<MovieInfo>This big-screen adaptation of Land of the Lost stars Will Ferrell as Dr. Rick Marshall, a quantum paleontologist who has been discredited in the scientific world due to his strident belief in time travel as the cure for all of humanity's problems. After hitting an all-time low, giving a lecture to elementary school kids, Dr. Marshall meets an ambitious young scientist named Holly (Anna Friel), who tells him she has followed all his work and believes he's a genius. Spurred on by her enthusiasm, he finishes building the device that will allow him to time travel -- something he promptly does along with Holly, and white-trash fireworks salesman Will (Danny McBride), after Will leads them into a cave that seems like a promising place to test the new machine. They end up in a world full of dinosaurs, sand, and scary lizard-like creatures known as Sleestacks. They quickly lose the machine that brought them to this alternate universe, and if they ever want to return home, the trio must recover it with the help of Chaka (Jorma Taccone), the monkey-like friend they make in this strange place. ~ Perry Seibert, Rovi PG-13,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>[A] gigantic chunk of scat.</review>
<review>Danny McBride and Will Ferrell make it worth a trip to Land of the Lost.</review>
<review>Who is this movie being made for in the first place?</review>
<review>By stringing together a bunch of campy retro set-ups and witty improvs, Land of the Lost manages to be a watchable comedy with plenty of laughs.</review>
<review>Land of the Lost is a terrible family film - let's just get that out there - but it is certain to live on as a staple of bleary-eyed uni students' movie nights; sandwiched in-between repeat viewings of The Wall.</review>
<review>Ladies and gentlemen- this is it. This is the moment where Will Ferrell's shtick (already wearing thin after his last couple of films) officially got old.</review>
<review>Better than "Bewitched," if only for its straightforwardness. Then again, even Nora Ephron didn't turn Will Ferrell into a colonoscopic agent for a dinosaur. Depending on if you like him, that may be a comic equivalent to the Berlin Wall's collapse.</review>
<review>...the film boasts a pervasively puerile sensibility that's reflected in virtually all of its attributes...</review>
<review>Not really a film version of the oft-rerun '70s Saturday morning staple that happens to star Will Ferrell, but rather a Will Ferrell movie that happens to bear the title and some concepts of the show.</review>
<review>Will Ferrell's and Danny McBride's natural charisma isn't sufficient to save Land of the Lost</review>
<review>An odd film, which will hardly be enough to turn it into the massive hit that it needs to be.</review>
<review>There are genuine thrills, gross-out moments, zingy lines and a Will Ferrell in solid form. No one asked for this movie, but now that it's here, we should be pleased.</review>
<review>By and large, it's knockabout kids' stuff (and has been advertised on that basis), but it has some quite risqué smut.</review>
<review>There's a docu-drama to be made about movies like this. About how no-one had the courage to tell the star: This ain't funny!</review>
<review>Humdrum adaptation that should, given the ripe nature of its source material, have been much better.</review>
<review>A ragbag of lackadaisical plotting, drugs references, puerile lechery and shiny effects work, an assemblage far from child-friendly yet not quite grungey enough to wow older teens.</review>
<review>It's not just the land that feels lost in Ferrell's lumbering latest. After Bewitched, you'd have thought he'd have learned to leave old TV shows well alone.</review>
<review>A doughily inexpressive Will Ferrell extinguishes any flicker of originality in one of the worst performances of his career.</review>
<review>It is very surreal, absurd, and often quite gross, with loads of very arch and knowing gags. It's not going to win any awards. Really, it's a DVD rental. There are some laughs. I laughed, anyway.</review>
<review>The humour is lame and more than a little smutty, while the plot barely hangs together.</review>

<name>Galaxy Quest</name>
<score>89</score>
<MovieInfo>A team of intrepid adventurers travels through the outer reaches of the galaxy, each week finding excitement and adventure on Galaxy Quest! Or at least that's the way it was in the mid-1970s, when brave if reckless Captain Peter Quincy Taggart, lovely Lieutenant Tawny Madison, and inscrutable alien Dr. Lazarus were the leaders of an interstellar law enforcement team on the TV series of that name. Twenty years later, the show is still in reruns, and Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), and Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman) prop up their sagging careers by making appearances at sci-fi conventions, where they grudgingly shake hands and give autographs for the show's socially inept following. However, it turns out that nerdy sci-fi fans aren't the only ones watching: somewhere in another solar system, a group of alien rebels living under a regime of violence and repression have picked up broadcasts of Galaxy Quest, and they aren't aware that it's fiction. They travel to Earth and encounter the Galaxy Quest cast, who figure that they're just another bunch of guys who like to dress funny. However, they soon realize that they're being hired not for another autograph-signing session but for a real-life outer space rescue mission. Galaxy Quest was directed by Dean Parisot, who had a background in TV directing before his theatrical debut with the dark comedy Home Fries. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi PG,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>A fantastic science fiction comedy</review>
<review>Hilarious, fast, funny, fresh fun for the family.</review>
<review>Galaxy Quest works not just as a parody or a send-up of a type of film. It works as a basic space adventure as well.</review>
<review>Before Tropic Thunder, there came this clever and satisfying spoof of "Star Trek" and its enduing fan phenomenon.</review>
<review>Despite a premise that sounds far from promising, GALAXY QUEST turns out to be an amusing adventure that ofers both good comedy and reasonably exciting science fiction.</review>
<review>While gently spoofing the old Star Trek series and honoring it, Galaxy Quest creates and inhabits its own uniquely lovable universe.</review>
<review>An enormously entertaining pop-culture ride.</review>
<review>Effects and production design are splendidly integrated into the overall enterprise, which is even more enjoyable for being so unexpected.</review>
<review>A hilarious spoof of Trek and Trek fandom. While Galaxy Quest could have easily taken potshots at geeks, rather the film acts as more of a celebration of these sometimes misguided devotees.</review>
<review>It's hip, it's funny and it is one of the better ensemble efforts -- both in front and behind the camera. I had a fun time.</review>
<review>A frivolous but funny comedy with great special effects and admirable performances. This should become a lasting classic, even for people who don't watch Star Trek, which it so cleverly spoofs.</review>
<review>A sparkling blend of sci-fi and comedy that affectionately spoofs every Star Trek cliché known to man, Romulan, or Klingon.</review>
<review>Relentlessly pokes fun at the rabid fans of sci-fi geekdom and the has-been actors that they deify . . . yet gives the geeks and has-beens get a chance to become real heroes</review>
<review>Even if you've never seen a Gene Roddenberry creation, it's still a hoot.</review>
<review>There are genuinely imaginative special effects which manage to be recognisably in the spirit of the cheesy originals.</review>
<review>Star Trek spoof boldly mocks where no one has mocked before.</review>
<review>An irresistibly silly, fluffy, giddy bit of fun.</review>
<review>More frequently than not, however, the screenplay by David Howard and Robert Gordon opts for safe and bland over satiric, leaving us with a movie that's watchable but frustrating since it's so rife with unexplored potential.</review>
<review>The idea of actors being mistaken for their roles was used in "The Three Amigos," but "Galaxy Quest" mines the comic potential better.</review>
<review>Meet the Thermians: the biggest science-fiction nerds of all time.</review>

<name>Tropic Thunder</name>
<score>83</score>
<MovieInfo>Ben Stiller's satirical look at Hollywood, Tropic Thunder concerns the production of an epic Vietnam War film that quickly derails thanks to the giant egos of everyone involved in the production. Stiller stars as Tugg Speedman, an action hero trying to segue out of that genre. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, a drug-addicted fat comic also attempting to change his image by taking on such a serious film. They star alongside Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), one of the world's most awarded actors, and a man who insists on immersing himself totally in a role. In this case, that means Lazarus has had his skin dyed in order to portray an African-American soldier. After their outrageous behavior lands the film's director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan), in very hot water with producer Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), Cockburn takes the advice of grizzled Vietnam vet Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte); in order to gain control of his performers, Cockburn drops the actors off in the jungle, planning to film the movie guerrilla-style with hidden cameras. When the group stumbles upon a heroin production camp, the actors are unaware that they are in very real danger. ~ Perry Seibert, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>Tropic Thunder is an easy film to enjoy. It appeals to the basest levels of humour without patronising its audience, while pricking the pomposity of the movie industry without going too 'meta' - this is far from self-fellation.</review>
<review>perfectly parodies the 'kill everything in sight and then blow it up for good measure' summer movie mentality.</review>
<review>Comes down to exactly the same type of heroic finale they're supposed to be parodying in the first place. You bettah off renting Rescue Dawn.</review>
<review>A clever structure, glorious ensemble cast and above all conviction ensure that laughter will be rippling like thunder inside the cinema.</review>
<review>There are a lot of sacred entertainment industry cows being sent to the slaughter, and Stiller &amp; co. skewer every stereotype with vicious glee.</review>
<review>Not a third as "dark" or "ferocious" as it believes it is</review>
<review>bilo je te%u0161ko izbje%u0107i jo%u0161 jednu tre%u0161nju holivudske gore koja je rodila mi%u0161a</review>
<review>Sure, there are some moments when the plot falls right down a gun barrel, the comedy is too over the top and the jokes are downright gross. Still, in comparison to the other slapstick comedies this year, this movie-within-a-movie strikes above the rest.</review>
<review>Sounds predictable and academic, but what's unexpected is how deftly Stiller manages to explore these issues and allude to war films from The Bridge on the River Kwai to Platoon to Rambo while still recognizing the value of a well-placed fart joke.</review>
<review>Tropic Thunder is one humongous vanity project for Ben Stiller. His initials aren't BS for nothing. If you can't get enough of bouncing Ben, Tropic Thunder is the movie for you. Ben Stiller acted in, co-wrote, produced, and directed Tropi</review>
<review>Is this a comedy -- or a cry for help?</review>
<review>Tropic Thunder turns out to be a very funny film with an immensely talented cast that will be the topic of any water cooler conversation.</review>
<review>Stiller's parody of Hollywood opportunism and insecurities is fairly lacerating, but perhaps could've been more so had not the whole thing been played so broadly.</review>
<review>Cruise is downright scary. It's the creepiest -- and most entertaining -- performance since his unforgettable appearance in that Scientology video.</review>
<review>The action movie has been spoofing itself for years. Half of the time it's no even intentional. Ben Stiller's hilarious and surprisingly intelligent Tropic Thunder takes the genre spoof to a new extreme.</review>
<review>Tropic Thunder focuses its satire on this Hollywoodization of war, as it depicts the production of a Vietnam genre film that's less "Platoon" than "Platoon Leader" with Michael Dudikoff.</review>
<review>A journey into Hollywood's heart of darkness.</review>
<review>Un excelente entretenimiento, realmente gracioso y divertido, que se permite tomarle el pelo a la misma industria de la que sale.</review>
<review>Even with its excess and undeniably heavy hand, this is a whole lot of fun as a satire of Hollywood, a take off on war/ action flicks and as a straight-ahead action movie.</review>
<review>... it attacks celebrity culture and the excesses of Hollywood filmmaking ... with a wink and slap on the back, celebrating that same culture as much as it ridicules it.</review>

<name>Inglourious Basterds</name>
<score>88</score>
<MovieInfo>A group of hardened Nazi killers stalk their prey in Nazi-occupied France as a Jewish cinema owner plots to take down top-ranking SS officers during the official premiere of a high-profile German propaganda film. As far as Lt. Aldo Raine (aka Aldo the Apache," Brad Pitt) -- is concerned, the only good Nazi is a dead Nazi. Raine's mission is to strike fear into the heart of Adolf Hitler by brutally murdering as many goose-steppers as possible, or die trying. In order to accomplish that goal, Lt. Raine recruits a ruthless team of cold-blooded killers known as "The Basterds" which includes baseball-bat-wielding Bostonian Sgt. Donnie Donowitz (aka "The Bear Jew," Eli Roth) and steely psychopath Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), among others. When the Basterds' secret rendezvous with turncoat German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) goes awry, they learn that the Nazis will be staging the French premiere of "The Nation's Pride," a rousing propaganda film based on the exploits of German hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl), at a modest theater owned by Jewish cinephile Shoshanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), posing as a Gentile after the brutal murder of her family by the ruthless Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). As the Basterds hatch an explosive plan to take out as many Nazis as possible at the premiere, they remain completely oblivious to the fact that Shoshanna, too, longs to bring the Third Reich to its knees, and that she's willing to sacrifice her beloved theater in the process. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>It's a long but entertainingly showy melodrama full of cineaste jokes, tricksy wordplay and references to film-makers GW Pabst, Leni Riefenstahl and Sergio Leone.</review>
<review>Despite failing to achieve epic greatness (or moral relevance), Inglourius Basterds is a helluva cinematic experience, rewriting the fall of the Third Reich in a way few directors would ever dare.</review>
<review>The experience is like savoring a box of imported French chocolates, only the last one is filled with the wrath of God.</review>
<review>For all its originality, this hall of mirrors is the closest Tarantino has come to making a film with old-fashioned, movie-movie appeal.</review>
<review>Waltz will be unknown to most American audiences -- he was certainly unknown to me -- but he's nothing less than sensational as the silky, polyglot SS officer charged by the Fuhrer to root out the remaining Jews in France.</review>
<review>Although the actors are flawless, it is Tarantino whose name will go hand in hand with the film -- he is by the modern definition of the word an "auteur."</review>
<review>There is absolutely no one like Tarantino. I think he's capable of anything. It's almost too much power for one filmmaker to have.</review>
<review>With Inglourious Basterds, he's managed to make a movie that will polarise more than ever; its lack of immediacy will frustrate casual audiences; its unfocused story will likely upset the QT hardcore.</review>
<review>They're inventing a new junk-food product line for Inglourious Basterds - the White Elephant Supreme.</review>
<review>Like a bat to the head, it's not too subtle, but you can't help but watch.</review>
<review>There will be blood.</review>
<review>Inglourious Basterds not only knows that it is a fictional movie, but also that it is being watched by an audience, and herein lays its greatest achievement.</review>
<review>WWII revamped Quentin Tarantino style, Inglourious Basterds succeeds as the ultimate fantasy revenge story, a Kill Hitler which stands as one the best works in the career of its influential filmmaker.</review>
<review>Tarantino is at times like a flamboyant, egomaniacal orchestra conductor, gesticulating wildly and turning to the audience to make sure we know that the show's about him.</review>
<review>Despite some of the scenes dragging on too long, Inglourious Basterds is still a lot of fun, altering history for the better as the Nazis feel the force of redemption.</review>
<review>Inglourious Basterds is worthy of Dr. Strangelove.</review>
<review>Shows how most of us turn to film for both fantasy escape and an avenue to make the abstract past tangible, enough to even possibly, and powerfully, replace actual history.</review>
<review>One of the best films of 2009, and another home run for Tarantino.</review>
<review>Quentin Tarantino seems to be hanging on to a lost world of moviemaking. He may be nuts. But he's a nut who cares.</review>
<review>Tarantino's World War II epic is both bloody and talky.</review>

<review>Visually striking, but also very violent.</review>
<review>A head-spinning dream project of extraordinarily bi-polar, nutso invention, Vol. 1 is a candy store rampage, cheering on Tarantino's fetishes as he built a colorful war machine of ideal double-feature dementia.</review>
<review>Quentin Tarantino's long awaited fourth film finds the pop culture carnivore of filmmaking reinvigorating cinema a second time over with a single-plot-trajectory revenge movie that utilizes samurai sword action with a shifting score of infectious guitar d</review>
<review>With its eclectic use of music and inventive mix of genres, Kill Bill is a striking and enigmatic revenge film visually and culturally rich and relentless in its action.</review>
<review>Something borrowed, something bloody. [Blu-ray]</review>
<review>Tarantino instead relies on delirious, high-octane, imaginative camera work; an anime sequence; and an exhilarating musical soundtrack to punch up a story that loses its intoxicating magnetism well before the final credits roll.</review>
<review>A strange, fun and densely textured work that gets better as it goes along.</review>
<review>Even more gory and adolescent than its models, which explains both the fun and the unpleasantness of this globe-trotting romp.</review>
<review>I didn't leave the cinema aching to see Volume Two (out in February), though I'm interested to learn how things work out.</review>
<review>Kill Bill is a temple of worship -- a devout hymn of praise to crap cinema (which isn't always crappy).</review>
<review>Kill Bill is pretty stupid, but there are also moments of beauty and brilliance.</review>
<review>Unfolding as a book the film is conceived in chapters, each boasting the look and pulse of a specific genre; as expected of Tarantino, there are references to music, literature, fashion, and above all movies and pop culture, both American and foreign.</review>
<review>It's all bang, bang; no kiss, kiss. But this is still bravura film-making from a prodigious talent, and Thurman may yet prove its saving grace.</review>
<review>One of the best films of the year, and, when it's all said and done, probably the decade.</review>
<review>Tarantino is back with his most polished and yet slightly empty effort yet.</review>
<review>A movie that, without Uma, would have ultimately been a stylistic masterpiece, but never the stirring epic that it is shaping up to be.</review>
<review>Perhaps the funniest thing about Kill Bill: Volume One is the realization that this ode to ultraviolence and Uma Thurman's feet is probably Quentin Tarantino's most personal film.</review>
<review>Volume One is, above all, a parade of fantastic fight scenes, each one bloodier than the one that came before ... bloody in the Looney-Toons/Monty-Python sense.</review>
<review>Different enough from Tarantino's previous work to finally win over even an inveterate Tarantino-sceptic like me.</review>
<review>There is no ironic overlay in Tarantino's movies, no 'commenting' on the pop schlock he's replicating. He simply wants to remake in his own way the kinds of movies he's always loved, and he's about as uncynical as a movie geek can be.</review>

<name>Death Proof</name>
<score>66</score>
<MovieInfo>In Death Proof -- director Tarantino's take on such peddle-to-the-metal shockers as White Line Fever -- Kurt Russell stars as an engine-revving psychopath who prefers to take out his beautiful victims at 200 mph. Originally released into theaters on a double bill with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror under the Grindhouse banner, Death Proof finds a group of ladies out on the town pitted against a mysterious figured named Stuntman Mike (Russell), whose vintage automobile has been partially modified to withstand even the most extreme auto collision. Though the maniacal driver himself always comes out relatively unscathed, the same certainly can't be said for the poor young lass in his passenger seat -- or anyone unfortunate enough to be on the road when the urge to kill strikes for that matter. With a list of potential road-kill candidates that includes Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, Rosario Dawson, and Vanessa Ferlito, Death Proof takes viewers on an adrenaline-infused drive that's as sexy as it is shocking. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<review>Death Proof doesn't simply comment on its genre inspirations - it adds to their very legacy.</review>
<review>As an anomaly, a curio, even as half a movie, it's a winner. As a stand-alone feature, it struggles to stand up to close scrutiny.</review>
<review>Tarantino's very bloody half of Grindhouse.</review>
<review>Freed from the constraints of the Grindhouse package, Death Proof can now spread out, find its proper rhythms, and emerge as another excellent Tarantino classic.</review>
<review>A comprovação de que, nas mãos de um diretor que conhece a fundo a técnica e a história do Cinema, até mesmo um exercício de estilo sem grandes ambições pode representar uma experiência apaixonante para quem ama e respeita a Sétima Arte.</review>
<review>Clearly the work of somebody who has ingested Carol J. Clover's Men, Women, and Chainsaws, yet it is also more</review>
<review>"raja" koja voli Tarantina %u0107e imati itekako razloga da mu oprosti ovaj eksperiment.</review>
<review>Feels much longer than it is.</review>
<review>Death Proof is superbly made. There's a terrible tension watching these beautiful and spirited young women getting too close to the flame, followed by enormous relief when the mood changes in the second story.</review>
<review>A well-controlled buildup of expectations, suspense, and character contrast.</review>
<review>The problem for Tarantino in Death Proof is that the girl talk that occupies so much of the running time is anything but true to the culture 50 years ago. The setting is contempo, but the movie style is period</review>
<review>I've rarely seen a filmmaker, in current Hollywood at least, expose his sexual and sadistic kinks on screen with such shameless glee.</review>
<review>A tedious, meaninglessly anachronistic project.</review>
<review>Deliberately designed to look like a low-grade B-flick from the Fifties, this slasher adventure from Quentin Tarantino is a guaranteed treat for that rare film fan nostalgic about the worst era in cinema.</review>
<review>While playing by the rules--scantily clad women, sudden brutality, straightforward narrative--he also gleefully subverts the genre to keep us thoroughly entertained.</review>
<review>Tarantino has a blast with this affectionate nod to '70s exploitation flicks, but the dialogue isn't as good as it should have been.</review>
<review>The dialogue with which Tarantino is usually adept is disastrously clunky, the filmmaking largely without flair and even the apeing of the smears and scratches of the schlock originals seems ridiculous.</review>
<review>Next to Kill Bill, this is only 50 per cent proof, but the last car chase will have you hanging on for dear life.</review>
<review>With its scratchy print, jerky editing and retro title sequence, Quentin Tarantino's fifth film bends over backwards to establish its Seventies sexploitation-flick credentials.</review>
<review>This blend of girlie action flick with retro car-chase movie scores nought out of 10 for artistic expression but four for amiable delinquency.</review>

<name>Mad Max</name>
<score>95</score>
<MovieInfo>This stunning, post-apocalyptic action thriller from director George Miller stars Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky, a policeman in the near future who is tired of his job. Since the apocalypse, the lengthy, desolate stretches of highway in the Australian outback have become bloodstained battlegrounds. Max has seen too many innocents and fellow officers murdered by the bomb's savage offspring, bestial marauding bikers for whom killing, rape, and looting is a way of life. He just wants to retire and spend time with his wife and son but lets his boss talk him into taking a peaceful vacation and he starts to reconsider. Then his world is shattered as a gang led by the evil Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) murders his family in retaliation for the death of one of its members. Dead inside, Max straps on his helmet and climbs into a souped-up V8 racing machine to seek his bloody revenge. Despite an obviously low budget and a plot reminiscent of many spaghetti Westerns, Mad Max is tremendously exciting, thanks to some of the most spectacular road stunts ever put on film. Cinematographer David Eggby and stunt coordinator Grant Page did some of their best work under Miller's direction and crafted a gritty, gripping thrill ride which spawned two sequels, numerous imitations, and made Mel Gibson an international star. One sequence, in which a man is chained to a car and must cut off a limb before the machine explodes is one of the most tense scenes of the decade. The American version dubbed all the voices -- including Gibson's -- in a particularly cartoonish manner. Trivia buffs should note that Max's car is a 1973 Ford Falcon GT Coupe with a 300 bhp 351C V8 engine, customized with the front end of a Ford Fairmont and other modifications. ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>Announcing a new kind of action-thriller, this impressively shot, ultra violent post-apocalyptic saga from Australia made Mel Gibson an instant star.</review>
<review>Mel Gibson rules the road in the original Mad Max.</review>
<review>Perhaps a bit clumsy in the lumbering middle act, but Mad Max delivers the goods when it comes to pulse-pounding car chases and stunts.</review>
<review>Despite its budget and other shortcomings, Mad Max is still worth watching and worth adding to the post-apocalyptic section of your home video collection.</review>
<review>Like all of the best exploitation films, it transcends its limitations while simultaneously embracing them.</review>
<review>The greatest example of Ozploitation movies, George Miller's 1979 "Mad Max" is a pure cinematic anomaly.</review>
<review>This is brutal, exciting stuff, all the more impressive for its budget constraints.</review>
<review>Classic cult fun made famous by director Miller and then new star Gibson.</review>
<review>The stunt work is spectacular.</review>
<review>Simple, but effective.</review>
<review>Overnight, Mad Max went from being a U.S. cult hero to a mainstream figure, and Mel Gibson's place in the firmament was secured.</review>
<review>Australia exported this creative, original, exciting, low-budget genre landmark which gave the young Mel Gibson his first starring role.</review>
<review>Stunts themselves would be nothing without a filmmaker behind the camera and George Miller, a doctor and film buff making his first feature, shows he knows what cinema is all about.</review>
<review>Some of the most determinedly formalist filmmaking this side of Michael Snow.</review>
<review>This was a great movie!</review>
<review>The tone sometimes wavers into self-parody, and there are occasional crude patches, but overall this edge-of-seat revenge movie marks the most exciting debut from an Australian director since Peter Weir.</review>
<review>Though director George Miller took the post-apocalyptic tough guy Max a lot farther in the sequel The Road Warrior, Mad Max still packs in Miller's particular brand of black-comedy thrills.</review>
<review>Encompasses the essence of the sexy revenge flick.</review>
<review>Cult low-budgeter that benefits from Miller's direction and Gibson's then lack of self-importance.</review>
<review>It's [the] car chases that make the first half of the film tolerable, which is devoid of any interesting characters or situations.</review>

<score>53</score>
<MovieInfo>Escape from L.A. finds Kurt Russell once again in the role of Snake, which he played in the 1981 film, Escape from New York. Los Angeles has finally had the really big earthquake everyone was afraid of, and what remains is now an island. Because the country's ultra-righteous President-for-Life (Cliff Roberton) wants it that way, all the weirdos and freaks that previously inhabited New York in large numbers, and the rest of the U.S. in smaller concentrations, have been quarantined on the island of L.A. The president has Snake taken from the nice, decent prison he was living in for a special mission in L.A. The president's daughter has joined the resistance movement determined to overthrow his one-man rule, and has stolen his secret "black box" (a doomsday machine) to boot. Snake is given a poison which will kill him in a few hours unless he returns to the president for the antidote. His mission is to recover the black box and kill the president's daughter. ~ Clarke Fountain, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<review>Violent, semi-spoofy action sequel is too dark for kids.</review>
<review>...for all its commotion, the movie never catches fire.</review>
<review>Escape from L.A. finds Carpenter in a playful mood.</review>
<review>In a summer filled with giant duds like Independence Day or The Rock or Chain Reaction, this is the best testosterone action flick of the season.</review>
<review>A dreadful belated sequel to the entertaining Escape From New York. Perfectly epitomizes how Carpenter's skills have eroded since his late '70s, early '80s heyday.</review>
<review>Diverting for the 100 minutes it runs, but once they're up, it is instantly forgettable.</review>
<review>A deliciously campy send-up of everything we love to hate about the Left Coast and the entertainment biz.</review>
<review>Sequels have reached an all-time low</review>
<review>Self-conscious sequel is a wipe-out.</review>
<review>I don't think most people gave ESCAPE FROM L.A. enough credit when it first came out ... Every bit as cheesy as I remember - but also a lot more fun!</review>
<review>Less a sequel than a really crappy remake!</review>
<review>Enjoyable in a playful way</review>
<review>The special effects vary from OK to lame to very lame.</review>
<review>Dark, percussive and perversely fun.</review>
<review>That noise you hear isn't an explosion; it's the sound of a great science fiction opportunity, being blown sky-high.</review>
<review>Escape from L.A. is too preposterous to be a good film. But in keeping with its title, it does provide a couple of hours of entertaining escapism.</review>
<review>Like Texasville, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, King Kong Lives and The Evening Star, Escape From L.A. stands tall as a shining beacon of Bad Moviedom.</review>
<review>Here and there a moments of wit shines through ... but for the most part the formulaic, auto-pilot nature of the enteprise leaves one wishing Carpenter and Russell had said 'never again' after Escape from New York.</review>
<review>Buscemi, Fonda, Robertson, Grier and many others get to make vivid impressions, but of course it's Russell who must carry this swiftly paced picture. As rugged as ever and attractively weathered, he does so with ease.</review>
<review>In his return as Snake Plisskin, Russell has an obvious ball.</review>

<review>The film's true strength is a snappy, whip-smart wit</review>
<review>Robert Downey, Jr. makes Iron Man one of the most entertaining superheroes in the Marvel movie universe.</review>
<review>The most mature of the "Iron Man" films by far.</review>
<review>Marvel Studios lets director Black off the leash for this third installment, and while the result is edgier, sexier, and more dangerous than what has come before, you may not recognize Tony Stark as the man from the long-running comic.</review>
<review>Funnier and smoother, more surprising, defter at being creative while still working within the confines of the superhero formula.</review>
<review>It's Iron Man 3's sneaky exposé of superhero cool--on the outside, a wisecracking warrior; on the inside, an anxiety-attacked guy who tries to insulate himself with arrogance--that brings this blockbuster down to sympathetic size.</review>
<review>There's little doubt that Iron Man Three, in its early stages, fares a whole lot better than one might've anticipated...</review>
<review>A generous step up from its predecessor, the various twists aren't exactly as expected, but you'll still have fun getting there.</review>
<review>Packed with virtually non-stop action from start to finish, "Iron Man 3" is the best film in the "Iron Man" series and among the best Marvel-inspired films ever</review>
<review>Features an interesting, angst-ridden psychological sub-text rarely found in blockbuster films.</review>
<review>This may be the lightest, most entertaining cinematic exploration of post-traumatic stress disorder yet.</review>
<review>The finale is explosive, but Iron Man has some rusty patches too</review>
<review>The way Black surrenders the movie's edginess to the generic onslaught of flashy visuals is a mild disappointment.</review>
<review>A regression in the usual strong work from Marvel Studios, Iron Man 3 suffers from director Shane Black's mishandling of this popular superhero character.</review>
<review>The elements that were once daring are starting to feel statistically approved - and tired.</review>
<review>Terrorist and anxiety attacks prove equally dismaying to Marvel's 'man in a can' in this witty, satisfying sequel.</review>
<review>Iron Hot with action</review>
<review>... best Iron Man yet thanks to Shane Black, who pushes characterization, clever plot twists, not computer effects ... Downey, for a change, drops his guard, shows the heart beneath the armor</review>
<review>It's the funniest superhero film, and it doesn't feel like it's pandering. That's the power of Downey, Jr. and now Shane Black.</review>
<review>A palatable entertainment... rests on the strength of the principals</review>

<review>The climax is the biggest letdown, a giant hash of crosscutting and unremarkable (in an era in which we've seen everything) CGI.</review>
<review>A competently made, sporadically entertaining superhero action movie that will make a lot of money for Marvel and Fox.</review>
<review>Good, clean summer movie fun where the money they spend is up on the screen - with actors and effects</review>
<review>Magneto used to be a globe-trotting Bond-a-like and Xavier was a beer-chugging ladies man? Admit it, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart suddenly seem much more interesting.</review>
<review>As visually impressive as X-Men: First Class can be, Vaughn is a natural storyteller and he never loses sight of what the big picture is.</review>
<review>This new entry to the "X-Men" saga will please fans and non-fans of the comic book heroes alike, shaking things up by giving us a little something new from the franchise.</review>
<review>Matthew Vaughn still proves that he's a terrific and entertaining filmmaker, while still retaining a distinct style.</review>
<review>Comic-book lovers, fans of alternate history, and fantasy-prone moviegoers in general are all sure to find something to love about X-Men: First Class.</review>
<review>One of the five worst films of 2011. Inexplicably acclaimed, incredibly dumb.</review>
<review>A first-rate action film with great special effects and an effective origin tale to tell--perhaps the best of the X-Men series so far.</review>
<review>With so many characters to introduce or reintroduce, Vaughn has a lot of ground to cover, and he does it in a way that at once feels retro and modern.</review>
<review>There's something to be respected about a film that doesn't spend most of its time in mindless action</review>
<review>As X-Men films go, this one gets the job done and is certainly better than Last Stand or Wolverine. But there are still just too darn many X-Men.</review>
<review>While it never reaches the intelligence or character richness of the first two X-Men films, it's still the superior superhero spectacle of 2011 to date.</review>
<review>As a story of the founding of the mutant academy, First Class delivers on the double meaning of its title, twice.</review>
<review>In Matthew Vaughn's pitch-perfect, fluid, sparklingly edited movie, we learn about demons. And wouldn't you know it? It's all about Jewish revenge.</review>
<review>Its attributes and weaknesses can be broken down into two categories: the relationship between Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), and everything else</review>
<review>In a summer unfortunately glutted with superhero movies, every one an origins story, X-Men: First Class not only eclipses its competition, but also each of its franchise predecessors.</review>
<review>First Class might even be too good for its predecessors' comfort. An unintended consequence of its sure handed grip on character is the retroactive tarnishing of the original films.</review>
<review>Not only the best X-Men film to date, but the best superhero flick yet.</review>

<score>29</score>
<MovieInfo>An ordinary lawman goes outside the law to carry out his own brand of justice in this dark-themed thriller. Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is an FBI agent who deeply loves his wife and son, but is also strongly devoted to his work. Castle's investigation of a powerful crime cartel leads to a gunfight which claims the life of a young boy, whose father is underworld kingpin Howard Saint (John Travolta). Furious and eager for revenge, Saint arranges for Castle and his family to be murdered in retaliation. However, while Castle's wife and son are killed, he somehow survives, even though he's believed to have perished. Bent on stopping Saint once and for all, Castle remakes himself as The Punisher, a ruthless and heavily armed killing machine who will not rest until Saint and his crew have been wiped clean from the Earth. Based on a Marvel Comics character first introduced in 1974, The Punisher also stars Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Laura Elena Harring, Roy Scheider, and Kevin "Big Sexy" Nash. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<review>Bad big screen adaptation of comic book.</review>
<review>Standard, styleless revenge fantasy.</review>
<review>Despite some admittedly strong moments it's certainly nothing special and barely above ordinary.</review>
<review>If you thought "Daredevil" was lousy, then you'll be thoroughly irritated by the asleep-at-the-wheel pacing of the story of the Punisher's origin.</review>
<review>Yet another trophy in Marvel's movie gallery...</review>
<review>A true study in the pathology of sadism that's also one of the best action films in years.</review>
<review>A comic-book-movie-that-pretends-it's-not that falls between stools.</review>
<review>There's something to be said for letting a comic book adaptation operate at the level of a comic book, dispensing cheap laughs and ice-cold sadism.</review>
<review>We are treated to John Travolta in yet another gloriously unconvincing evil guy role as...a cross between Hugh Hefner and his own Tony Manero from Saturday Night Fever.</review>
<review>Listless, lifeless, uninterestingly bleak and quite often ridiculous.</review>
<review>Ultimately, Frank's victim -to-vigilante transformation is so morally unexplored it's emotionally alienating.</review>
<review>The biggest guilty pleasure of 2004. An entertaining throwback to the kind of hardcore vigilante films Charles Bronson used to star in.</review>
<review>It could make you cry, laugh or just shout out for more bloody violence, but regardless of your reaction, you're going to love it.</review>
<review>The Punisher is Commando with an identity crisis.</review>
<review>Run of the mill revenge proped up with a couple of good fights and a singing assassin.</review>
<review>Ungainly and grim, the movie is loaded with comic-book heroic clichés and explosive effects (the surfeit just turns silly by film's end).</review>
<review>This reactionary revenger will bring real satisfaction to fans of Bush's foreign policy -- but probably not to anybody else.</review>
<review>I enjoyed this film because I took it with a grain of salt and viewed it as a comedy. If you're looking to see a serious thriller, this is not it.</review>
<review>A comicbook action movie with an unpleasant edge.</review>
<review>Revenge, they say, is a dish best served cold. Leftovers like this don't count.</review>

<score>27</score>
<MovieInfo>Marvel Comics' vigilante character The Punisher gets another big-screen outing in this third film incarnation of the character, this time from Green Street Hooligans director Lexi Alexander. Fueled by revenge and aided by his trusted weapons expert, Microchip (Wayne Knight), vigilante Frank Castle (Rome's Ray Stevenson) turns the New York City streets red with blood as he takes down each and every member of the crime syndicate responsible for the death of his wife and two kids. As the law-appointed "Punisher Task Force" closes in on him, the antihero does battle with Billy Russoti (Dominic West), aka Jigsaw, a nickname given by him to reflect the disfigurement handed to him by Castle. With the help of his psychotic brother, Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison), Jigsaw recruits the criminals of the city to band together to bring down The Punisher, using the wife (played by Dexter's Julie Benz) and daughter of a slayed FBI agent as bait. Art Marcum, Matt Holloway, and Nick Santora provide the screenplay for the Lionsgate release. ~ Jeremy Wheeler, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<review>A blithely depraved shoot-'em-up in which its glum protagonist cuts a retributive swath across a vast criminal underworld, Punisher: War Zone echoes back to the unthinking low-budget action movies of the 1980s.</review>
<review>The final damning verdict left by the American box office, whom far from raced out to see it, meaning takings of 8m leave Punisher: War Zone the lowest grossing Marvel adaptation to date.</review>
<review>...stands as the best offering out of Hollywood that Punisher fans could've hoped for.</review>
<review>One can assume another reboot will be in the offing after this monstrosity tanks at the box office.</review>
<review>Part '80s action movie, part gross-out horror, this guilty pleasure is Saw meets Rambo . . .</review>
<review>God I love my revenge films...</review>
<review>Unlike more high-powered Marvel heroes like Spider-Man and X-Men, The Punisher has never enjoyed much box office success and this excruciatingly terrible film certainly won't change that.</review>
<review>Earning an 18 certificate with its violence, the film is kids' stuff in all other respects: over-the-top shootouts, monstrous and barking-mad villains, a bumbling sidekick and so on. Highly enjoyable tosh.</review>
<review>The IQ is as low as the body count is high and the uncharismatic Ray Stevenson might as well have been wearing a mask for all the emotion he shows.</review>
<review>It's a good old-fashioned guns-andaction romp - and I love it.</review>
<review>You couldn't call it shoddy, exactly, and the actors take it painfully seriously; it's just dispiriting to see all this endeavour in the service of something so humourless and disgusting.</review>
<review>The punishment doesn't end there, with anyone who hands over good money to watch this dreck also likely to feel the pain.</review>
<review>Another violently unsuccessful attempt to bring this comic book character to screen.</review>
<review>'Oh God, now I've got brains spattered all over me,' exclaims The Punisher's slippery inside man, Detective Soap. You may feel the same at the end of this messy, sadistic reboot of the Marvel comic-book series.</review>
<review>Pleasantly surprising - providing you're not put off by all the gore and dismemberment.</review>
<review>Castle/the Punisher is not the most charismatic comic book hero at the best of times but Stevenson's jowly pallor and oil slick of hair makes him look more like an Eastern European abattoir worker than a vigilante to be reckoned with.</review>
<review>The franchise simply can't compete with better written and directed comic book offerings out there. This includes Howard The Duck...</review>
<review>Marvel, stop punishing yourselves and put this unworkable franchise out of our misery.</review>
<review>As entertaining as Punisher: War Zone is, there's no real depth, the plot is obvious and it's a wee bit charmless.</review>
<review>This is as true to a Marvel comic tale as I've ever seen - gory, serious, intense, dark and utterly psychotic.</review>

<name>Spider-Man</name>
<score>89</score>
<MovieInfo>After incorporating elements of comic book style and design into many of his films, director Sam Raimi helms this straight-ahead, big-budget comic book adaptation, which also marks acclaimed young actor Tobey Maguire's first dip into live-action blockbuster filmmaking. Spider-Man follows the template of the original Stan Lee/Steve Ditko source material, with hero Peter Parker an orphaned, intellectual teen loner living in Queens with his aunt (Rosemary Harris) and uncle (Cliff Robertson), and dreaming of the girl next door, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). On a field trip to a Columbia University lab, Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider and overnight he gains superhuman strength, agility, and perception. At first, Peter uses his powers for material gain, winning a wrestling match with a purportedly lucrative prize. But when Peter apathetically fails to stop a burglar from robbing the wrestling arena, a tragedy follows that compels him to devote his powers to fighting crime -- as the superhero Spider-Man. When he's not busy fighting crime in a spider suit, Peter moves into an apartment with his best friend, Harry (James Franco), and begins work as a photographer at the Daily Bugle. Meanwhile, his do-gooder alter ego finds a nemesis in the form of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), a super-powered, megalomaniacal villain who happens to be the alter ego of Harry's father, weapons-manufacturing mogul Norman Osborn. Spider-Man was written by the prolific blockbuster scribe David Koepp (Jurassic Park, Panic Room). ~ Michael Hastings, Rovi PG-13,</MovieInfo>

<review>When the cast and their director are really cooking, they conjure a bipolar sense of high school-age emotion -- and use it to fuel outrageous fantasy.</review>
<review>Spider-Man is an effortless, intelligent entertainment, and a fabulous, fun-filled start to the hugely lucrative franchise.</review>
<review>Not since 1978's Superman has there been a live-action, comic book-based film so savvy at mixing self-aware camp with sincere emotion, and so successful at establishing the normal guy life of its spandexed protagonist.</review>
<review>Full of swinging action but finding plenty of time to explore the people behind the masks, Spider-Man is a franchise with real legs. At last, a blockbuster that lives up to the hype.</review>
<review>Maybe having such a big budget and being able to afford so many computer effects (which aren't so hot anyway) crippled the creativity of the film.</review>
<review>With earnest, unpretentious delivery, Maguire is an eminently likable hero audiences will root for from his earliest moments as the class wimp.</review>
<review>At its best, Spider-Man takes the adolescent yearning at the heart of most superhero sagas and gives it a lovely swing.</review>
<review>Coarse mayhem notwithstanding, Spider-Man will probably provoke a pandemic of arachnophilia.</review>
<review>The perils and advantages of being bitten by a genetically modified spider are made abundantly clear in Sam Raimi's enjoyable, if broken-backed, exercise in high-cost pulp.</review>
<review>This crowd-pleaser is a highly satisfying rendering of Lee's reluctant hero, one that captures the broken heart and tortured soul of a young man whose coming of age arrives with a perilously high price tag.</review>
<review>Captures the high-energy, pulpy effervescence of Marvel when it was young and feisty... whatever imperfections the film picks up along the way, they practically demand to be hand-waved aside.</review>
<review>It's got all that you'd want from superhero movie and more. A truly enjoyable film.</review>
<review>Fun movie, but may be too intense for younger kids.</review>
<review>In emphasizing angst over energy, the movie is much like its hero -- not the dashing crime fighter in a red-and-black bodysuit but the introspective nerd who both endears and exasperates.</review>
<review>Sam Raimi has gotten the exact mix right to create certainly one of the best superhero films ever made.</review>
<review>Spider-Man is funny, poignant and true to form with Tobey Maguire and company fleshing out the famed comic-book characters with aplomb.</review>
<review>Finally, a fully faithful adaptation to a comic book icon, save for some bumps along the road. It's a fun movie.</review>
<review>A vibrant piece of pop entertainment that serves as the perfect start to the summer season.</review>
<review>An adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero adventures that effectively takes time between exhilarating digital effects to develop character and motivation.</review>
<review>Colourful, energetic and well-cast, Spider-Man is a good-quality, highly-entertaining action movie.</review>

<reviews>
<review>This reboot works with a freshness and seriousness that was often missing from the 2002 Tobey Maguire film.</review>
<review>The primary effect of this movie to keep conjuring up better movies.</review>
<review>This umphundredth origin story of a nerdy outsider turned unlikely crime fighter is surprisingly enjoyable.</review>
<review>Other than recasting and swapping out love interests for the spindly web-slinger, there's nothing here that wasn't there 10 years ago in the original.</review>
<review>The bigger standouts are scenes of character transformation. these moments alone are worth the price of admission. They are the reason to keep seeing summer blockbusters on a big screen. There are few new ideas, but still plenty of new thrills.</review>
<review>One good film deserves another.</review>
<review>One of the ten best films of 2012.</review>
<review>The recasting works. If Maguire is the Spider-Man of Spidey co-creator Steve Ditko, this is the Spider-Man of artist John Romita: a little slicker, a little more modern. Spider-Man in skinny jeans, if you will.</review>
<review>For a superhero origin film, it's pretty good, but it's hardly amazing.</review>
<review>It's almost impossible to watch the film without thinking of what could have -- and what already has -- been, therefore it's extremely difficult to enjoy on its own merit.</review>
<review>I go to a Spider-Man movie to see the guy duke it out with powerful bad guys. I'm simple that way. I don't need a welter of convolutions.</review>
<review>This edgier Parker feels a more believable alter-ego - closer to the wise-cracking, ass-kicking hero from the comics and early animated TV series.</review>
<review>"The Amazing Spider-Man" isn't as dramatically revisionist as Christopher Nolan's "Batman Begins," but it's as good as Raimi's first "Spider-Man" film and darker, while still being tongue-in-cheek. That's a tough tone to master.</review>
<review>A superior film that promises to age better than Sam Raimi's films...</review>
<review>The potential is there for a much bigger, better, Spider-Man movie universe to come, even if this movie doesn't fully realize that potential.</review>
<review>We all know that Spider-Man 3 sucked, but did it have to come to this? A 'one strike and you're out' policy? I would have taken a Raimi/Maguire Spider-Man 4 over this retread any day.</review>
<review>Not quite 'amazing' then, but there will always be a deserving audience for rock-solid superhero movies done with this kind of heart and care.</review>
<review>The Amazing Spider-Man may be a reboot, but it feels entirely fresh thanks to a strong, different interpretation of the Spider-Man mythos and tremendous performances from the excellent ensemble.</review>
<review>After the film's runtime of over two hours, you may be surprised how little of it sticks with you.</review>
<review>"The Amazing Spider-Man" would be amazing if we didn't just see it a few years ago.</review>

<review>Hancock is what happens when you have talented people working on quality material: it's really a no-brainer that it works so well.</review>
<review>Kicks into tired oh-it-sucks-to-have-superpowers territory and opens up a can of racial issues it has no intention of investigating</review>
<review>I have no problem signing on to recommend this. Get it? Signing on...John Hancock... nevermind.</review>
<review>A few actors such as Clint Eastwood, marry substance and popularity. But very few. Most actors' egos lead them to slum in the box office. I'm reminded of this often when a major, talented actor opts for popularity instead of substance when the latter beck</review>
<review>...an engaging and thoroughly innovative spin on the superhero genre...</review>
<review>What an odd movie!</review>
<review>This is a different take on the superhero genre with an interesting, offbeat twist.</review>
<review>A fun, fairly crisp opening hour gives way to a muddled, entirely unsatisfying ending.</review>
<review>The strain of messianism in Will Smith movies is becoming ever more pronounced.</review>
<review>It becomes an entirely different film, one not really premised on the bad-superhero comedy idea, and the film is then oddly without a sense of humour, and its vague interest in satire vanishes completely.</review>
<review>Train wrecks are intrinsically spectacular, and Will Smith's new movie offers a doozy. Two of them, in fact.</review>
<review>A relatively satisfying ending that leaves just enough of an opening to warrant a sequel if the box office receipts are right.</review>
<review>Smith and Bateman are great, and the first half of the movie is terrific. The second half...well, you'll either go with it or you won't.</review>
<review>Will Smith, Fourth of July, superhero. It all seems to add up to a great combination. But they only made half a film.</review>
<review>The fourth of July will not be the only day for fireworks, July 2nd will definitely heat up at your local theatre when Hancock is released. Be sure to check it out.</review>
<review>While the film never quite reaches an Alan Moore-level deconstruction of the superhero mythos, it has a fun time offering up all the joy of a big-budget action movie without taking things too seriously.</review>
<review>The most adult of the new wave of superhero dramas.</review>
<review>Has plenty of funny, even tender moments until it veers in a different, messy direction an hour in.</review>
<review>It's let down by a disappointingly uneven plot, painfully underwritten characters and dodgy effects.</review>
<review>Smart enough to use the CGI madness in service to the story, rather than just ending and scene or conflict with a big effecty showdown. (I'm looking at you, Transformers!)</review>

<name>I, Robot</name>
<score>58</score>
<MovieInfo>Director Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow) helmed this sci-fi thriller inspired by the stories in Isaac Asimov's nine-story anthology of the same name. In the future presented in the film, humans have become exceedingly dependent on robots in their everyday lives. Robots have become more and more advanced, but each one is preprogrammed to always obey humans and to, under no circumstances, ever harm a human. So, when a scientist turns up dead and a humanoid robot is the main suspect, the world is left to wonder if they are as safe around their electronic servants as previously thought. Will Smith stars as Del Spooner, the robot-hating Chicago cop assigned to the murder investigation. Bridget Moynahan, Bruce Greenwood, James Cromwell, and Chi McBride also star. ~ Matthew Tobey, Rovi PG-13,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>Will Smith almost redeems generic man vs. machine actioner.</review>
<review>Pretty to look at but there's not much under the hood in this Isaac Asimov-based futuristic murder mystery...</review>
<review>It feels like an anonymous Hollywood studio film that overwhelmed the director with the demands to fashion a blockbuster vehicle for its star.</review>
<review>The movie is at least a bit less annoying than director Alex Proyas' previous two genre attempts.</review>
<review>Smith's occasional sullenness suggests he is itching for another Ali-like chance to prove his acting chops even as he slums his way through another high-tech shoot-'em-up.</review>
<review>If you are looking for proof that Hollywood has completely run out of ideas, check out I, Robot.</review>
<review>As I, Robot details how Smith must fight for his survival against an army of white men whom he alone knows are evil, the film might have been called 'I, Hollywood'.</review>
<review>For those who like their sci-fi to have the depth and breadth of comic books.</review>
<review>...passable as a vibrating escapist flick in spite of Proya's sporadically flat direction and the uneven interpretation of Asimov's wry commentary</review>
<review>An enjoyable action flick.</review>
<review>A dull, derivative [film] with no new ideas and a main character who, while clearly simple-minded, is somehow the smartest guy in the story.</review>
<review>Nobody is going to mistake this future noir for Spielberg's Minority Report, but for a light-headed adrenaline rush, it works pretty well.</review>
<review>The extras begin with an intelligent, interesting and thorough audio commentary by director Alex Proyas and writer Akiva Goldsman.</review>
<review>A film so detached from Asimov's vision, it emerges as a destabilized attempt at reworking an already-polished concept.</review>
<review>Based on Isaac Asimov's short story collection and directed by Alex Proyas, who did much better with 'Dark City' and 'The Crow.'</review>
<review>This is jaw-droppingly juvenile and insulting to my intelligence. Perhaps its subject matter is obsolete. Asimov deserved better.</review>
<review>An uninspired, recycled action thriller.</review>
<review>Whether there's anything substantial under the sheen and CGI of Alex Proyas' glistening future vision is debatable, but this enjoyable, engrossing picture is at least intelligently artificial.</review>
<review>It may or may not come as a surprise, but Will Smith is out-acted by the robots.</review>
<review>Better than anyone had any right to expect.</review>

<score>57</score>
<MovieInfo>The interstellar battle between the Autobots and Decepticons rains destruction down on planet Earth as director Michael Bay adapts Hasbro and Takara's popular Transformers franchise into a big-budget, live-action summer tentpole extravaganza in this ambitious sci-fi action feature starring Shia LaBeouf, Tyrese Gibson, Bernie Mac, John Turturro, Jon Voight, and, of course, Optimus Prime and Megatron. Long ago, on the planet of Cybertron, a massive, powerful alien race divided into two factions, the noble Autobots, and the devious Decepticons. They fought for the sole access to a talisman known as the Allspark, a cube with the capacity to grant infinite power, and eventually the Autobots smuggled it off the planet's surface, hiding it in an unknown location on Earth. Now, hundreds of years later, the Deceptacons have come looking for it, and if the Autobots don't find it first, the Earth will be enslaved or destroyed by the evil aliens' use of its massive power. The Autobots don't know where the cube was hidden, but the information may be stored in the most unlikely of sources, as a gangly young Earthling named Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) who's just picked up his first car, has a strange connection to the Allspark's history, making him the unlikely ally of these enormous creatures, as they fight for humankind's survival and the chance to return home. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi PG-13,</MovieInfo>

<review>Transformers leaves very few blocks left un-busted.</review>
<review>hat was delivered will no doubt send merchandising sales spiralling into orbit, but sadly at the cost of countless brain cells popping through after nearly two and a half hours of tedium.</review>
<review>Transformers delivers on its promise of stunning visuals and well-crafted action sequences, but it's not remotely worth the slog it takes to get there. Once the novelty of the robots wears off it's hopelessly insipid.</review>
<review>Bay, of course, can't resists temptation to use as many explosions in the film as possible</review>
<review>Morphs from Army-enlisting ad to toy ad (on its way passing through a panoply of car ads, computer ads, beer ads) without ever becoming a movie</review>
<review>Thank god the Transformers speak primarily in proper nouns--if they hadn't shouted "Optimus! Megatron!" every time they struck a blow, I'd have no idea what was happening.</review>
<review>Transformers is a rollicking, rousing experience.</review>
<review>For the bot-neutral rest of us, two-and-a-half hours of mostly incoherent special effects may be a bit much.</review>
<review>It is a teenage boy's wet dream. The girls are insanely hot, the lead is awkward/funny and the action sequences are top notch.</review>
<review>...if you are an adult and not already a fan, you may find the movie more than a bit long, loud, and frenzied.</review>
<review>Come to think of it, I was pretty stupid when I was six years old. So is this film.</review>
<review>Director Michael Bay's bigger than life version of the cartoon I grew up loving pretty much ruined one of my favorite childhood memories.</review>
<review>Although it strives to appeal to the whole family, it winds up emerging as a kiddie flick on steroids - a big-budget, effects heavy, feature film version of a Saturday morning cartoon.</review>
<review>Transformers is the best action movie I have seen since The Matrix.</review>
<review>'Transformers' is a loud, unsophisticated testament to the visceral thrills of effects-driven mayhem.</review>
<review>An overachiever of a film that practically defines the term summer blockbuster.</review>
<review>If you take Transformers with a grain of salt...you'll have a pretty fun time checking out both the robotic (transformers) and human (Megan Fox) eye candy</review>
<review>When Transformers is going strong early on, it's the grandest -- in every sense of the word -- entertainment in years.</review>
<review>The action scenes are too chaotic to be exciting.</review>
<review>Audiences are liable to be in a state of utter bewilderment.</review>

<score>60</score>
<MovieInfo>A gritty, white-knuckle, action ride set in the near-future where the sport of boxing has gone high-tech, Real Steel stars Hugh Jackman as Charlie Kenton, a washed-up fighter who lost his chance at a title when 2000-pound, 8-foot-tall steel robots took over the ring. Now nothing but a small-time promoter, Charlie earns just enough money piecing together low-end bots from scrap metal to get from one underground boxing venue to the next. When Charlie hits rock bottom, he reluctantly teams up with his estranged son Max (Dakota Goyo) to build and train a championship contender. As the stakes in the brutal, no-holds-barred arena are raised, Charlie and Max, against all odds, get one last shot at a comeback. -- (C) Dreamworks PG-13,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>This movie about robot boxing needs more robot boxing.</review>
<review>Real Steel envisions a future where boxing has evolved into giant fighting robots. Great special effects and cool fight choreography makes this a must-see.</review>
<review>Good thing we all love Hugh Jackman so much</review>
<review>Real Steel offers plenty of fun and engaging moments -- of both the human character drama and giant CGI robot battle variety.</review>
<review>"Real Steel" just never gives us a reason to care, and for two hours that can be quite detrimental.</review>
<review>...the film benefits substantially from the inclusion of several unexpectedly engrossing robot-on-robot fight sequences...</review>
<review>Wow, they actually made Rock Em Sock Em Robots - The Movie! Even more surprising is how amazing this movie is. Filled to the brim with heart, soul, grit, and fun. One of the best movies of 2011.</review>
<review>The visual effects are a slick combination of real robots and CGI, and -- especially on the new Blu-Ray release -- the result is gloriously seamless.</review>
<review>By no means is Real Steel an original film, at least in terms of its base story, but that doesn't mean it's not an effective, tear-jerking kids movie.</review>
<review>Clash time between the machines is nigh overwhelming in this never-before-seen context, and that's the payoff here.</review>
<review>"Real Steel" has all the brainless fun of Rock'em Sock'em Robots and the heart and rousing fight sequences of "Rocky."</review>
<review>Never in a million years did I think that I would enjoy a boxing robot movie from the director of Night at the Museum.</review>
<review>apolyta tairiasth retrofoytoyristikh proseggish, poy pantreyei thn fantasiwsh twn binteogkeimadwn me tis klasikoteres twn istoriwn patrikhs eksilewshs kai anatrophs twn pithanothtwn</review>
<review>'Real Steel' about an estranged son and his father, a man who's been beaten down by repeated failures, a needy boy who finds something he can believe in, and, of course, it's a sports movie, too, because it's sort of a metallic 'Rocky.'</review>
<review>This much is clear as soon as they meet: father and son have matching attitudes, both resentful of their sudden connection and very tough on the outside even as they're really vulnerable.</review>
<review>A film that feels as if it's been written by a five-year-old who's been allowed to create it as some sort of bizarre birthday present this is undemanding all the way</review>
<review>The robots are fun, but the script never gets beyond cliches</review>
<review>Characters' smug, this-is-so-cool!ness and jingoistic, heartland subtext tries to knock us into submission. The hero's one of those animatronic adults in kid's clothing.</review>
<review>Silly, corny and featuring nearly every boxing cliché... But fighting robots? Dads and their young sons will have a blast.</review>
<review>Even with my sense of humor firmly intact, I'm not sure that I've seen a more crassly manipulative movie this year. As cold and calculating as movies get -- a glossy, soulless piece of junk that wants you to cheer along, but it doesn't earn one ounce.</review>

<score>22</score>
<MovieInfo>An outsider teen acclimating to a new school finds a home in a reclusive teenaged fight club in this drama from Cry_Wolf director Jeff Wadlow. Jake Tyler (Sean Faris) has just moved with his family to Orlando, FL. While Jake isn't exactly comfortable being the new kid in town, his younger brother, Charlie (Wyatt Smith), is an aspiring professional tennis star who might just have what it takes to break big. But Charlie isn't the only talented athlete in the family, because Jake used to be something of a hotshot on the gridiron -- at least back home. Here in Orlando, Jake is considered something of a hothead thanks to his penchant for brawling. In an attempt to better fit in with his new classmates, Jake accepts flirtatious classmate Baja's (Amber Heard) invitation to a raucous party. There, the short-fused newcomer is lured into a fight and badly beaten by local bully Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet). But a beam of hope shines through the humiliation when a classmate who sees potential in the defeated fighter informs Jake of a local MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) program run by Jean Roqua (Djimon Hounsou). Despite Jake's preconceived notions regarding MMA, he quickly discovers that it's not just another form of street fighting but a rich new art form that he longs to master. As Roqua takes Jake under his tutelage, it soon becomes apparent that in order to become a true MMA champion, Jake will have to learn patience, discipline, willingness, and reason. This isn't just a quest for revenge, but an opportunity for Jake to finally find out what kind of man he truly is. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi PG-13,</MovieInfo>

<review>Bloody fight film has heart, but it's no champion.</review>
<review>A naive and truly obnoxious movie about the world of Mixed Martial Arts.</review>
<review>While the character of Jake isn't an emotionally taxing one, Faris has his moments, especially in a low-key scene in which he attempts to explain why his character is full of rage.</review>
<review>Here's what I hoped for: someone to root for, someone to root against, an inspiring coach, some eye candy and, of course, training montages. I got what I wanted.</review>
<review>A sort of teenage Fight Club, complete with daddy issues, Never Back Down is a slight refinement of the sort of picture that was ascendant in the '80s... [Blu-Ray]</review>
<review>A generic, violent underdog story that pays a lot of lip service to non-violence when its characters aren't busy kicking and punching the tar out of each other.</review>
<review>People that actually think the trailer looks cool will probably like the movie enough and it does have some cool fights, I just couldn't get past the fact that the movie gave you no one to root for.</review>
<review>While both [this movie and "Karate Kid"] are unintentionally hilarious, the difference is no one will remember "Never Back Down" in two weeks, let alone 20 years.</review>
<review>The acting is hammy, Djimon Hounsou shows up to give the flick a corny air of Karate Kid and there's nothing particularly original about the whole premise but somehow it works. It must be those abs. Or the kicks to them.</review>
<review>Come back Mr Miyagi, all is forgiven.</review>
<review>A cliché-ridden guilty pleasure.</review>
<review>The Karate Kid meets Fight Club but it's no way near as good as it sounds.</review>
<review>Enjoyably trashy teen flick that plays like a dumbed-down version of Fight Club, enlivened by an engaging lead performance by star-in-the-making Sean Faris.</review>
<review>The result is an entertaining roller coaster of emotions and actions, with Djimon Hounsou bringing dignity and meaning to his role as Jean, the martial arts coach with his own demons to conquer</review>
<review>Jeff Wadlow's direction is disorderly.</review>
<review>If you think about what this film is saying, the superficiality is overwhelming.</review>
<review>Even for the trashy sub-genre it belongs to, "Never Back Down" is sadly just lazy action pablum as will the five Straight to DVD sequels be. I'll just stick to "Karate Kid"...</review>
<review>Amid all this conventional-plotty mishmash, it's not a newsflash that the role of Jean, the tireless, morally upright and vaguely spiritual mentor, is especially grating.</review>
<review>A cross between "The Karate Kid" and "Fight Club," though without the A-list cast. That's right, the A-list cast. When compared to the D-listers assembled in "Back Down," Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio might as well be A-list.</review>
<review>Movie is dopey. And with its emphasis on stupid violence, xylophone abs, and getting yourself on YouTube, it's yet another product that makes you feel bad about today's youth culture.</review>

<name>Fight Club</name>
<score>81</score>
<MovieInfo>In this darkly comic drama, Edward Norton stars as a depressed young man (named in the credits only as "Narrator") who has become a small cog in the world of big business. He doesn't like his work and gets no sense of reward from it, attempting instead to drown his sorrows by putting together the "perfect" apartment. He can't sleep and feels alienated from the world at large; he's become so desperate to relate to others that he's taken to visiting support groups for patients with terminal diseases so that he'll have people to talk to. One day on a business flight, he discovers Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charming iconoclast who sells soap. Tyler doesn't put much stock in the materialistic world, and he believes that one can learn a great deal through pain, misfortune, and chaos. Tyler cheerfully challenges his new friend to a fight. Our Narrator finds that bare-knuckle brawling makes him feel more alive than he has in years, and soon the two become friends and roommates, meeting informally to fight once a week. As more men join in, the "fight club" becomes an underground sensation, even though it's a closely guarded secret among the participants. (First rule: Don't talk about fight club. Second rule: Don't talk about fight club.) But as our Narrator and Tyler bond through violence, a strange situation becomes more complicated when Tyler becomes involved with Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), whom our Narrator became infatuated with when they were both crashing the support-group circuit. Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club was directed by David Fincher, who previously directed Pitt in the thriller Seven. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11, capturing perfectly both the stirring discontent of the Nineties and the madness (both geopolitical and especially economic) that would erupt globally in the decade to come.</review>
<review>Fight Club jettisons its sense of humour 60 minutes in, and, so far from satirising the tiresome "crisis of masculinity" stuff sloshing around the airwaves either side of the Atlantic, the film simply endorses it.</review>
<review>Wildly inventive, exceptionally cast and undeniably controversial, there's an endless list of subtexts and viewpoints which will fuel student pub debates for years.</review>
<review>A controversial satire and a contemporary classic.</review>
<review>It is working American Beauty-Susan Faludi territory, that illiberal, impious, inarticulate fringe that threatens the smug American center with an anger that cannot explain itself, can act out its frustrations only in inexplicable violence.</review>
<review>Blistering, hallucinatory, often brilliant, the film by David Fincher is a combination punch of social satire and sociopathology.</review>
<review>Fight Club is an arresting, eventually appalling excursion into social satire by way of punishing violence.</review>
<review>A movie that wants to keep its audience unsettled from beginning to end.</review>
<review>We're meant to take the male bonding and the blood rituals as a protest against the sterility of corporate life and modern design, but Fincher's sadomasochistic kicks overwhelm any possible social critique.</review>
<review>There's many levels of brilliance to this film, from the script to the acting to the cinematography to the overall directing.</review>
<review>This is American self-absorption at its finest.</review>
<review>A shrewd, scintillating work rooted in an investigation of varying degrees of masculinity and extremism.</review>
<review>Lurid, twisted, and violent. Not for kids.</review>
<review>where Taxi Driver sees the fallacy in canonizing Travis Bickle, Fight Club does it without irony.</review>
<review>The last great male-centric movie of the last millennium just arrived on a spectacular new Blu-ray disc for its 10th anniversary, providing the opportunity to relish every aspect of David Fincher's ultimate dissection of Gen-X masculinity. Fight Club</review>
<review>A complex, confused look at life in late-'90s America, David Fincher's blood-black comedy Fight Club remains one of the most divisive pictures of the past 20 years.</review>
<review>Fight Club is still today a definitive film, a statement as strong as any rock anthem and twice as packed with power chords.</review>
<review>One of the seminal films of the 1990s...just as darkly funny, epic, and psychically wrenching as ever. [Blu-ray]</review>
<review>"Fight Club" is a cinematic Hail-Mary pass from David Fincher that the audience desperately wants to catch.</review>
<review>[A] bold, inventive, sustained adrenaline rush of a movie...</review>

<score>84</score>
<MovieInfo>Director David Fincher's dark, stylish thriller ranks as one of the decade's most influential box-office successes. Set in a hellish vision of a New York-like city, where it is always raining and the air crackles with impending death, the film concerns Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a homicide specialist just one week from a well-deserved retirement. Every minute of his 32 years on the job is evident in Somerset's worn, exhausted face, and his soul aches with the pain that can only come from having seen and felt far too much. But Somerset's retirement must wait for one last case, for which he is teamed with young hotshot David Mills (Brad Pitt), the fiery detective set to replace him at the end of the week. Mills has talked his reluctant wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), into moving to the big city so that he can tackle important cases, but his first and Somerset's last are more than either man has bargained for. A diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. First, an obese man is forced to eat until his stomach ruptures to represent gluttony, then a wealthy defense lawyer is made to cut off a pound of his own flesh as penance for greed. Somerset initially refuses to take the case, realizing that there will be five more murders, ghastly sermons about lust, sloth, pride, wrath, and envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. Somerset is correct, and something within him cannot let the case go, forcing the weary detective to team with Mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion. The moody photography is by Darius Khondji; the nauseatingly vivid special effects are by makeup artist Rob Bottin, best known for more fantasy-oriented work in films like The Howling (1981). ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>The movie is riveting in a gut-twisting way, but I, myself, would not call it "entertaining."</review>
<review>Unfortunately, the movie's clammy design, glum cinematography, and lugubrious pace try to persuade us that what we're watching isn't an ingenious, silly piece of pulp but a serious meditation on the nature of evil.</review>
<review>... An unrelenting examination of the evil that may or may not be festering inside every one of us.</review>
<review>An intensely claustrophobic, gut-wrenching thriller.</review>
<review>Grim, slick, shocking thriller. Older teens only.</review>
<review>Despite some truly fantastic work throughout the '90s and 2000s, Se7en still remains director David Fincher's best film, albeit by a very narrow margin.</review>
<review>David Fincher is at the top of his form with Seven, one of the darkest, creepiest, and most brilliant serial killer pictures in American film history, far more interesting than Silence of the Lambs.</review>
<review>Fincher and Walker take these hackneyed ingredients, play with them in the context of a brilliantly cohesive plot, and present something consistently fresh -- and very, very dark.</review>
<review>The filmmakers stick to their vision with such dedication and persistence that something indelible comes across--something ethically and artistically superior to The Silence of the Lambs that refuses to exploit suffering for fun or entertainment.</review>
<review>The situation is formulaic, but director David Fincher contrives a stylish, intentionally ugly look that transcends the pulp narrative.</review>
<review>So chic, studied and murky it resembles a cross between a Nike commercial and a bad Polish art film.</review>
<review>The real star of Seven, however, is the gloom and doom of the setting: an unidentified blight of a modern city.</review>
<review>The most disquieting and powerful Hollywood thriller in years.</review>
<review>If you think you know where the story is going, think again. This movie has an unconventional ending worthy of the anti-hero movies of the Seventies.</review>
<review>Fincher handles the violence with sensitivity, announcing its obscenity in spoken analyses and briefly glimpsed post mortem shots, but never showing the murderous acts themselves.</review>
<review>The opening credit sequence is a mini masterpiece of filmmaking.</review>
<review>The crime scenes are rendered in sickening detail, and the whole film has a murky, madly pretentious tone.</review>
<review>The angles, the faded tones, the close-ups and quick cutting to intense music were all so unusual and disconcerting I was caught off guard. I immediately felt both mesmerized and at risk. And that was just during the opening credits.</review>
<review>Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman give great performances in this film.</review>
<review>A harrowingly bleak vision that haunted me in the theatres and made my flesh slick with fear even on this recent re-viewing.</review>

<MovieInfo>Following the phenomenal success of The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, Anthony Hopkins returns as brilliant madman Hannibal Lecter in this thriller based on the novel in which author Thomas Harris introduced the character. Will Graham (Edward Norton) is an FBI agent with a rare gift for tracking serial killers who brought Hannibal Lecter to justice; however, his confrontation with Lecter proved to be a bloody, near-death experience, and afterward Graham retired from the Bureau, moving to Florida to spend his time with his wife, Molly (Mary-Louise Parker), and their son. However, a particularly grisly killer is on the loose, and Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel), Graham's one-time mentor at the Bureau, asks him to return to duty to find him. The "Tooth Fairy" is a vicious murderer who kills entire families at once, covering the eyes of his victims with bits of a shattered mirror. Graham finds he needs help putting together the pieces of the "Tooth Fairy" case, and he calls upon Lecter looking for advice. Lecter, at once vaguely helpful and self-serving, as usual, offers scraps of information to Graham which help him zero in on the killer. But Lecter knows more than he's telling; the "Tooth Fairy" is actually Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes), a troubled and withdrawn man who admires Lecter's violent panache and corresponds with him. Dolarhyde works at a film processing lab, where one of his co-workers, a blind woman named Reba McClane (Emily Watson), seems to be quite attracted to him. As Dolarhyde wrestles with both his murderous impulses and his feelings for McClane, Lecter plays Graham and Dolarhyde against one another so that, as the FBI agent comes closer to catching "the Tooth Fairy," Dolarhyde moves in on his next victim -- Graham's family. Red Dragon marked the second time Harris' novel of the same name had been brought to the screen; five years prior to The Silence of the Lambs, Michael Mann adapted the book for the screen as Manhunter, which starred William Petersen as Graham and Brian Cox as Lecter. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>Great, but too scary and violent for most teens.</review>
<review>A surprisingly good and entertaining finisher...</review>
<review>The film oozes contempt for its audience, caring nothing for the characters or suspense and only craving money.</review>
<review>Frank Whaley and Philip Seymour Hoffman play minor characters so annoying they might as well wear T-shirts reading 'Eat My Brain.'</review>
<review>A decent enough entertainment that sticks closely to the novel.</review>
<review>Where Mann and Demme steered the hokum away from dull genre generalities, Ratner's point-and-film literalness churns out a thriller by rote, shorn of the psychological dogfighting that distinguished the first two films.</review>
<review>Who would've guessed the guy who gave us Money Talks, Rush Hour and The Family Man had what it takes to realize a thriller as smartly effective as this?</review>
<review>Hopkins should know better than to lessen the impact of these performances with redundant encores.</review>
<review>Its thrills fall with metronome-like precision, exactly when they are expected, and the clues complete the puzzle without surprise or personality.</review>
<review>Ratner, Tally and Hopkins bring back the elements that made Lambs one of the creepiest films ever made ...</review>
<review>Tenso e envolvente, o filme conta com belas atuações (especialmente de Fiennes) e é infinitamente superior à fraca versão dirigida por Michael Mann em 1986.</review>
<review>Sometimes a remake can be better than the original. This doesn't happen very often, but...Thus it is with Bret Ratner's remake of Michael Mann's "Manhunter."</review>
<review>Psychological thrillers became a dime a dozen after the success of Lambs, but Red Dragon is at least worth your $7.50.</review>
<review>Because this is the second time he's pimped out this Oscar-winning meal ticket for a hefty paycheck, maybe Anthony Hopkins should be forced to give his statuette back.</review>
<review>A thoroughly entertaining, efficiently mounted thriller.</review>
<review>The movie is flawed but the DVD is stuffed with extras.</review>
<review>If you've seen the original it's like watching a well-rehearsed covers band.</review>
<review>a damn good suspense movie, against all reasonable expectations. Best of all, however, is the return of Anthony Hopkins as evil incarnate himself, Doctor Hannibal Lecter</review>
<review>...So packed with good acting it's hard to know where to begin praising it.</review>

<score>94</score>
<MovieInfo>Red Dragon, the Thomas Harris novel that introduced serial killer Hannibal Lecter to the world, was adapted for the screen by Michael Mann as Manhunter. Ace criminal profiler Will Graham (William Petersen) is very good at his job because he has the ability to make himself think like the killers he tracks. Will has been in retirement since catching Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter (Brian Cox), as being inside that particular deranged mind caused Will to have a breakdown. Will's boss Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina visits Will at his home, showing him pictures from a murder scene and asking for his help in catching a new killer they have dubbed "the Tooth Fairy" (Tom Noonan). In order to test his mental strength, Will visits Hannibal in his prison cell. Adding to the already substantial mental stress Will experiences when he returns to the job are nosy tabloid reporter Freddy Lounds (Stephen Lang), as well as Hannibal's attempts at seeking revenge through the Tooth Fairy. After two additional films that featured Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter (Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal) became box-office blockbusters, Manhunter was re-made as Red Dragon starring Hopkins and Edward Norton as Will Graham. ~ Perry Seibert, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<review>Cox's Hannibal is a masterclass in moderation.</review>
<review>At the very worst an intriguing misfire, and often much better than that.</review>
<review>Eminently worthy and stylish.</review>
<review>Manhunter ushered in the age of empathy for the devil.</review>
<review>I'm intrigued by that stylistic envelope: simultaneously hypnotic and enervating, meditative and empty.</review>
<review>One of the most impressive American thrillers of the late '80s.</review>
<review>While Manhunter is absorbing and sometimes tense, it's unfortunate that Mann dedided to direct the film with the stylistic overkill of his Miami Vice.</review>
<review>gripping and creepy</review>
<review>The movie drives along with such intensity for much of the time that you can just let it work on your senses without worrying about whether it makes sense.</review>
<review>Unlike Hannibal, [Mann is] able to balance style and substance with a late-night hearse pace.</review>
<review>A grim, stylish thriller.</review>
<review>One of the worst movies ever made. How do people think this is effective? It's so schmaltzy and sloppy and careless. No tension, no terror, and Hannibal does not put his feet up!</review>
<review>I was always expecting Don Johnson to pop up...</review>
<review>A slick and glossy thriller that still stands out.</review>
<review>Its Miami Vice sheen hides one of the most effective thrillers in recent memory; a dramatically different counterpunch to the better-known Silence of the Lambs.</review>
<review>Michael Mann is in top form here helming this bone-chilling thriller based on the novel by Thomas Harris.</review>
<review>[An] engaging, thought-provoking and entertaining film that deserved its cult status.</review>
<review>Hold out for Red Dragon.</review>
<review>Lean serial-killer thriller makes The Silence of the Lambs look sheepish.</review>

<name>Phenomena (Creepers)</name>
<score>77</score>
<MovieInfo>Declared "my most personal film" by Italy's premier horror director Dario Argento, this production marked the director's return to the eerie thematic territory he pioneered in 1977 with the horror classic Suspiria. Much like that film, Phenomena conforms to the logic of nightmares. Jennifer Connelly stars as Jennifer Corvino, the daughter of an American film star, who enrolls in a prestigious Swiss boarding school under the tutelage of the prudish Mrs. Bruckner (played by frequent Argento collaborator and former beau Daria Nicolodi). Possessing a unique telepathic gift, Jennifer is capable of communicating with insects on an instinctive level, often while sleepwalking. This trait soon brands her a "freak" among her snooty classmates but makes her a valuable asset to entomologist Dr. MacGregor (Donald Pleasence), who is currently employing the innate forensic skills of insects to aid police in tracking a serial killer targeting the boarders at Jennifer's school. As Jennifer's tiny friends (including the corpse-hunting Sarcophagus Fly) guide her closer to the murderer's lair, everything from MacGregor's revenge-driven pet chimpanzee to Bruckner's monstrously disfigured son figure into the mix, providing not one but three shocking endings. Shot in English and re-dubbed for various European markets, this graphic thriller was released in drastically edited form as Creepers in the U.S. and England; Argento's original cut runs 110 minutes. ~ Cavett Binion, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<review>so over-egged is the story with police procedural, insect science and paranormal events that squaring the circle of all these clashing frames becomes a disorienting thrill with heady pleasures of its own.</review>
<review>Worth catching if you're a hardcore Argento fan. Otherwise, pass.</review>
<review>... Phenomena works best when viewed as a contemporary fairy tale.</review>
<review>Excellent horror flick.</review>
<review>If the Devil is the Lord of the Flies, what does that make Jennifer Connelly as a disturbed teenager who can telepathically communicate with the buzzing buggers?</review>
<review>Don't expect logic -- and don't expect anything remotely approaching reality -- and you'll be OK.</review>
<review>Phenomena (a.k.a. Creepers) provides what is alternately Argento's most batty and spiritual landscape.</review>

<MovieInfo>Based on the controversial sequel novel of the same name, Hannibal is the much-anticipated follow-up to the Oscar-winning The Silence of the Lambs (1991). Anthony Hopkins returns as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, one of the world's most cunning and feared serial killers, who resurfaces after a decade in hiding to toy with FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore). As Starling's career flounders thanks to a drug bust gone wrong, Lecter attempts to elude a greedy Italian police detective (Giancarlo Giannini) who's willing to alert the authorities to his presence in Florence for a price. In the meantime, a maimed but wealthy former victim of Lecter's named Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) plots to get his revenge on the doctor in a most unusual and grisly fashion. The novel by Thomas Harris was adapted for director Ridley Scott by David Mamet and Steven Zaillian. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<review>Thoroughly distasteful. Not for kids.</review>
<review>Doesn't work as its own individual, self-contained cinematic entity.</review>
<review>A dark and complexly entertaining ride, highly generous to multiple viewings.</review>
<review>The near-impossible taks and insurmountable problems have been handled by Scott in a proficient if unexciting way. Aware that he can't possibly meet viewers' expectations, Scott has made a different film, more florid, baroque, and tongue-in-cheek.</review>
<review>Scott's elegant, shadowy atmosphere and deliberate pacing make the film a delightfully spooky experience.</review>
<review>The weight-watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that's enjoyably spicy but low on substance.</review>
<review>There are moments of a good movie buried amongst this over the top thriller. But these moments are all too rare.</review>
<review>Pork chops get even!</review>
<review>Hannibal doesn't grip the audience with the macabre wit and pervasive sense of impending evil of its predecessor</review>
<review>Where the book kept you wondering and marvelling at the intricacies of the human mind and heart, the film has a sour, smart-alecky conclusion which highlights (what else?) the gore.</review>
<review>Perhaps Scott should have rented out Se7en before he yelled 'action' - the best horror is often what you don't see.</review>
<review>Director Scott has used his considerable talent to dress up this film into an artful, visually impressive affair.</review>
<review>Minus all the mystique of Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal has a few interesting scenes, but fails in equal portion.</review>
<review>Hannibal is not quite what I'd call a 'good' movie, but it could so easily have been worse in countless ways that I'm more than satisfied by the way it turned out.</review>
<review>Hannibal is a beautiful mess. Take your joys when you can because the well is often dry.</review>
<review>More character study than thriller, it can stand on its own merits. It's probably not exactly what you wanted, but it just might be enough.</review>
<review>Fails to live up to the original: gorier, flashier, funnier, even -- but nowhere near as exciting.</review>
<review>No wonder lesser minds hate this movie: it's radically different from Silence -- a bloody, suspense-driven, darkly comedic love story between good and evil, a florid, grandiose thriller manifesto on why polar extremes need each other to survive.</review>
<review>Memo to Hollywood: If a little is good, more is not necessarily better.</review>
<review>For all its blockbuster build-up, beneath the glitter Hannibal is just a big old barfbag full of stupid, steaming Hollywood spew.</review>

<review>Images jump, blip, strobe, and shock like an epileptic seizure - all the result of director Darren Lynn Bousman's lack of trust in his screenplay.</review>
<review>Witness the distortion of the series' original premise bastardized by those who believe they know better.</review>
<review>The power of "Saw III" lies not in the gore, torture, or tension, but in the relationship between Amanda and Jigsaw.</review>
<review>The extreme gore is gratuitous, and character development non-existent in a movie packed with the cookie-cutter visual design of the previous two films. Torturer, victim and audience become one.</review>
<review>Staying mostly faithful to the successful blueprint of its two earlier installments, Saw III is an adequate sequel that works well enough on its own terms.</review>
<review>Face your fears. A lesson worthy of praise, if the film preaching them weren't so completely full of s***.</review>
<review>Nihilistic, amoral, self-congratulatory wanking.</review>
<review>Starts with an interesting premise but quickly squanders it on the usual barely-glimpsed bloodbaths.</review>
<review>One of the most sadistic, brutal, grisly films of the current splatter-porn genre.</review>
<review>The only brains on display are the ones that get drilled out of human skulls.</review>
<review>It requires a stretch of the imagination too far, but there's still plenty of gore and tricksy murders here.</review>
<review>If humorless torture marathons like this represent the future of American horror cinema, it's time for Hollywood to officially outsource the genre overseas, where they remember the pleasures of a good scare.</review>
<review>full review in Greek</review>
<review>Saying that the newest Saw movie is better than the last one is a bit like saying that your latest root canal was better than your last one.</review>
<review>The third Saw in the franchise loses its edge.</review>
<review>No one will ever be able to accuse series creators and scribes Leigh Wannell and James Wan of being stingy with the red stuff.</review>
<review>Pretentious, with Jigsaw a splatter Mitch Albom.</review>
<review>If you found Hannibal's brain cooking scene a tad too much, you will want to avoid Saw III; but if you are a fan of the gory versions of horror, this will be an iconic essential</review>
<review>I couldn't watch Saw III without thinking of reality TV shows like Fear Factor. Can it be a deliberate parody?</review>

<MovieInfo>Three American students studying art in Rome are drawn into a grim world of torture and suffering in director Eli Roth's blackly comic sequel to the horror hit that shocked the world. Beth (Lauren German), Whitney (Bijou Phillips), and Lorna (Heather Matarazzo) have ventured outside of their stateside surroundings in order to get a more worldly appreciation of the arts. But sketching nudes all day can take its toll on even the most talented artist, and when class is over the three girls jump at the opportunity to experience Europe firsthand. As they set out on the train for an impromptu weekend trip, however, the coeds are surprised to cross paths with the beautiful model they had just been sketching. It appears that she, too, is preparing for a vacation that promises to be both relaxing and rejuvenating, and a generous invitation to join her at a remote hostel surrounded by soothing hot springs ultimately proves too tempting for the adventurous Americans to pass up. Unfortunately for the unsuspecting students, one person's idea of relaxing can be another's worst nightmare. Now on an unavoidable collision course with two American businessmen who long to get an edge on their competition by experiencing the thrill of the kill and a scythe-wielding woman who maintains her youthful visage using the Elizabeth Bathory method, these unsuspecting students are about to fall into a trap that remains one of the sadistic and wealthy elite's most well-guarded secrets. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi R,</MovieInfo>

<reviews>
<review>Gory torture bloodbath checks in for another stay.</review>
<review>There are some grisly deaths gore hounds would approve of, but the focus is more on the motives of the murderous pervs and the inner workings of the snuff corporation.</review>
<review>Poseur callousness all the way</review>
<review>Filmmaker Eli Roth tries to enliven the formula, but this sequel loses the grim surprise of the original without adding much new in terms of plotting or gory set pieces.</review>
<review>This second film definitely shows Roth's absolute courage as a director. He didn't pull any punches with this follow up.</review>
<review>The lasting effect of all three of Eli Roth's films is a certain kind of Grand Guignol "Punk'D", in which the "mark" is not only embarrassed, he's also cut to pieces.</review>
<review>Roth não é apenas um sujeito doente e repulsivo, mas também um picareta sem talento que usa seus filmes para torturar o espectador como num de seus "albergues".</review>
<review>In the end, one comes to the conclusion that Roth, like his mentor Quentin Tarantino, is someone who is very good at talking the talk but can't quite bring himself to walk the walk and himself make the kind of film his own are parasitic upon.</review>
<review>Roth's satire of fright junkie male castration fears and feminist castration fantasies, mandates that you're going to have to have your cock and eat it too, whether consumed live during elegant dining to the sound of opera, or by killer canine pets.</review>
<review>Roth's dark humor and lacerating view of human weakness sometimes suggest George Romero; what he lacks is Romero's stubborn belief in personal morality.</review>
<review>Hostel, Part II is bad, but it's not the most objectionable torture porno by any conceivable yardstick.</review>
<review>Sadly, the director's proven creative finesse has given way to boring self-imitation. Hostel: Part II gives us the same premise as the first film, changing genders and little else.</review>
<review>Oh, do grow up.</review>
<review>One may as well watch a marathon of American beheadings at the hands of Iraqi insurgents with popcorn in hand - the entertainment value is surprisingly comparable.</review>
<review>Picking up where the first film ended, writer-director Roth adds two angles to his formula, but neither is enough to make this grisly film worth watching.</review>
<review>...marks a substantial leap forward in terms of [Eli Roth's] directorial abilities.</review>
<review>It is pretty boring. But then the gore is even worse to watch.</review>
<review>Unlike the original's many imitators, this follow-up at least tempers its atrocities with satirical humour.</review>
<review>Hostel: Part II does succumb to mere ghoulishness in the last-reel bloodbath, but up to that point its moral tension feels horribly persuasive.</review>
<review>Cue the blood-gushing finale, which has a few surprises up its sleeve. I wasn't a fan of the original and, despite Hostel: Part II's slicker look, I'm still not.</review>
