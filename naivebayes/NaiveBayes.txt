probability that a document d is in class c = p(c|d)

choose the c with maximum p(c|d)

our trainingset is half positive, half negative. This explains the 0.5 constant:
p(c|d) = log(0.5) + p(d|c)

p(d|c) = log(p(t1|c)) + log(p(t2|c)) + ... + log(p(tn|c))
where t = term = word/number

p(t1|c) = (1 + (the number of occurences of t1 in c)) divided by (total amount of words in c)
